SIDDHARTHA
AN
INDIAN
TALE
BY
HERMANN
HESSE
FIRST
PART
TO
ROMAIN
ROLLAND,
MY
DEAR
FRIEND
THE
SON
OF
THE
BRAHMAN
IN
THE
SHADE
OF
THE
HOUSE,
IN
THE
SUNSHINE
OF
THE
RIVERBANK
NEAR
THE
BOATS,
IN
THE
SHADE
OF
THE
SAL-WOOD
FOREST,
IN
THE
SHADE
OF
THE
FIG
TREE
IS
WHERE
SIDDHARTHA
GREW
UP,
THE
HANDSOME
SON
OF
THE
BRAHMAN,
THE
YOUNG
FALCON,
TOGETHER
WITH
HIS
FRIEND
GOVINDA,
SON
OF
A
BRAHMAN.
THE
SUN
TANNED
HIS
LIGHT
SHOULDERS
BY
THE
BANKS
OF
THE
RIVER
WHEN
BATHING,
PERFORMING
THE
SACRED
ABLUTIONS,
THE
SACRED
OFFERINGS.
IN
THE
MANGO
GROVE,
SHADE
POURED
INTO
HIS
BLACK
EYES,
WHEN
PLAYING
AS
A
BOY,
WHEN
HIS
MOTHER
SANG,
WHEN
THE
SACRED
OFFERINGS
WERE
MADE,
WHEN
HIS
FATHER,
THE
SCHOLAR,
TAUGHT
HIM,
WHEN
THE
WISE
MEN
TALKED.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
BEEN
PARTAKING
IN
THE
DISCUSSIONS
OF
THE
WISE
MEN,
PRACTISING
DEBATE
WITH
GOVINDA,
PRACTISING
WITH
GOVINDA
THE
ART
OF
REFLECTION,
THE
SERVICE
OF
MEDITATION.
HE
ALREADY
KNEW
HOW
TO
SPEAK
THE
OM
SILENTLY,
THE
WORD
OF
WORDS,
TO
SPEAK
IT
SILENTLY
INTO
HIMSELF
WHILE
INHALING,
TO
SPEAK
IT
SILENTLY
OUT
OF
HIMSELF
WHILE
EXHALING,
WITH
ALL
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
HIS
SOUL,
THE
FOREHEAD
SURROUNDED
BY
THE
GLOW
OF
THE
CLEAR-THINKING
SPIRIT.
HE
ALREADY
KNEW
TO
FEEL
ATMAN
IN
THE
DEPTHS
OF
HIS
BEING,
INDESTRUCTIBLE,
ONE
WITH
THE
UNIVERSE.
JOY
LEAPT
IN
HIS
FATHER'S
HEART
FOR
HIS
SON
WHO
WAS
QUICK
TO
LEARN,
THIRSTY
FOR
KNOWLEDGE;
HE
SAW
HIM
GROWING
UP
TO
BECOME
GREAT
WISE
MAN
AND
PRIEST,
A
PRINCE
AMONG
THE
BRAHMANS.
BLISS
LEAPT
IN
HIS
MOTHER'S
BREAST
WHEN
SHE
SAW
HIM,
WHEN
SHE
SAW
HIM
WALKING,
WHEN
SHE
SAW
HIM
SIT
DOWN
AND
GET
UP,
SIDDHARTHA,
STRONG,
HANDSOME,
HE
WHO
WAS
WALKING
ON
SLENDER
LEGS,
GREETING
HER
WITH
PERFECT
RESPECT.
LOVE
TOUCHED
THE
HEARTS
OF
THE
BRAHMANS'
YOUNG
DAUGHTERS
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
WALKED
THROUGH
THE
LANES
OF
THE
TOWN
WITH
THE
LUMINOUS
FOREHEAD,
WITH
THE
EYE
OF
A
KING,
WITH
HIS
SLIM
HIPS.
BUT
MORE
THAN
ALL
THE
OTHERS
HE
WAS
LOVED
BY
GOVINDA,
HIS
FRIEND,
THE
SON
OF
A
BRAHMAN.
HE
LOVED
SIDDHARTHA'S
EYE
AND
SWEET
VOICE,
HE
LOVED
HIS
WALK
AND
THE
PERFECT
DECENCY
OF
HIS
MOVEMENTS,
HE
LOVED
EVERYTHING
SIDDHARTHA
DID
AND
SAID
AND
WHAT
HE
LOVED
MOST
WAS
HIS
SPIRIT,
HIS
TRANSCENDENT,
FIERY
THOUGHTS,
HIS
ARDENT
WILL,
HIS
HIGH
CALLING.
GOVINDA
KNEW:
HE
WOULD
NOT
BECOME
A
COMMON
BRAHMAN,
NOT
A
LAZY
OFFICIAL
IN
CHARGE
OF
OFFERINGS;
NOT
A
GREEDY
MERCHANT
WITH
MAGIC
SPELLS;
NOT
A
VAIN,
VACUOUS
SPEAKER;
NOT
A
MEAN,
DECEITFUL
PRIEST;
AND
ALSO
NOT
A
DECENT,
STUPID
SHEEP
IN
THE
HERD
OF
THE
MANY.
NO,
AND
HE,
GOVINDA,
AS
WELL
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
BECOME
ONE
OF
THOSE,
NOT
ONE
OF
THOSE
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
BRAHMANS.
HE
WANTED
TO
FOLLOW
SIDDHARTHA,
THE
BELOVED,
THE
SPLENDID.
AND
IN
DAYS
TO
COME,
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
WOULD
BECOME
A
GOD,
WHEN
HE
WOULD
JOIN
THE
GLORIOUS,
THEN
GOVINDA
WANTED
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
AS
HIS
FRIEND,
HIS
COMPANION,
HIS
SERVANT,
HIS
SPEAR-CARRIER,
HIS
SHADOW.
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
THUS
LOVED
BY
EVERYONE.
HE
WAS
A
SOURCE
OF
JOY
FOR
EVERYBODY,
HE
WAS
A
DELIGHT
FOR
THEM
ALL.
BUT
HE,
SIDDHARTHA,
WAS
NOT
A
SOURCE
OF
JOY
FOR
HIMSELF,
HE
FOUND
NO
DELIGHT
IN
HIMSELF.
WALKING
THE
ROSY
PATHS
OF
THE
FIG
TREE
GARDEN,
SITTING
IN
THE
BLUISH
SHADE
OF
THE
GROVE
OF
CONTEMPLATION,
WASHING
HIS
LIMBS
DAILY
IN
THE
BATH
OF
REPENTANCE,
SACRIFICING
IN
THE
DIM
SHADE
OF
THE
MANGO
FOREST,
HIS
GESTURES
OF
PERFECT
DECENCY,
EVERYONE'S
LOVE
AND
JOY,
HE
STILL
LACKED
ALL
JOY
IN
HIS
HEART.
DREAMS
AND
RESTLESS
THOUGHTS
CAME
INTO
HIS
MIND,
FLOWING
FROM
THE
WATER
OF
THE
RIVER,
SPARKLING
FROM
THE
STARS
OF
THE
NIGHT,
MELTING
FROM
THE
BEAMS
OF
THE
SUN,
DREAMS
CAME
TO
HIM
AND
A
RESTLESSNESS
OF
THE
SOUL,
FUMING
FROM
THE
SACRIFICES,
BREATHING
FORTH
FROM
THE
VERSES
OF
THE
RIG-VEDA,
BEING
INFUSED
INTO
HIM,
DROP
BY
DROP,
FROM
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
THE
OLD
BRAHMANS.
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
STARTED
TO
NURSE
DISCONTENT
IN
HIMSELF,
HE
HAD
STARTED
TO
FEEL
THAT
THE
LOVE
OF
HIS
FATHER
AND
THE
LOVE
OF
HIS
MOTHER,
AND
ALSO
THE
LOVE
OF
HIS
FRIEND,
GOVINDA,
WOULD
NOT
BRING
HIM
JOY
FOR
EVER
AND
EVER,
WOULD
NOT
NURSE
HIM,
FEED
HIM,
SATISFY
HIM.
HE
HAD
STARTED
TO
SUSPECT
THAT
HIS
VENERABLE
FATHER
AND
HIS
OTHER
TEACHERS,
THAT
THE
WISE
BRAHMANS
HAD
ALREADY
REVEALED
TO
HIM
THE
MOST
AND
BEST
OF
THEIR
WISDOM,
THAT
THEY
HAD
ALREADY
FILLED
HIS
EXPECTING
VESSEL
WITH
THEIR
RICHNESS,
AND
THE
VESSEL
WAS
NOT
FULL,
THE
SPIRIT
WAS
NOT
CONTENT,
THE
SOUL
WAS
NOT
CALM,
THE
HEART
WAS
NOT
SATISFIED.
THE
ABLUTIONS
WERE
GOOD,
BUT
THEY
WERE
WATER,
THEY
DID
NOT
WASH
OFF
THE
SIN,
THEY
DID
NOT
HEAL
THE
SPIRIT'S
THIRST,
THEY
DID
NOT
RELIEVE
THE
FEAR
IN
HIS
HEART.
THE
SACRIFICES
AND
THE
INVOCATION
OF
THE
GODS
WERE
EXCELLENT--BUT
WAS
THAT
ALL?
DID
THE
SACRIFICES
GIVE
A
HAPPY
FORTUNE?
AND
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
GODS?
WAS
IT
REALLY
PRAJAPATI
WHO
HAD
CREATED
THE
WORLD?
WAS
IT
NOT
THE
ATMAN,
HE,
THE
ONLY
ONE,
THE
SINGULAR
ONE?
WERE
THE
GODS
NOT
CREATIONS,
CREATED
LIKE
ME
AND
YOU,
SUBJECT
TO
TIME,
MORTAL?
WAS
IT
THEREFORE
GOOD,
WAS
IT
RIGHT,
WAS
IT
MEANINGFUL
AND
THE
HIGHEST
OCCUPATION
TO
MAKE
OFFERINGS
TO
THE
GODS?
FOR
WHOM
ELSE
WERE
OFFERINGS
TO
BE
MADE,
WHO
ELSE
WAS
TO
BE
WORSHIPPED
BUT
HIM,
THE
ONLY
ONE,
THE
ATMAN?
AND
WHERE
WAS
ATMAN
TO
BE
FOUND,
WHERE
DID
HE
RESIDE,
WHERE
DID
HIS
ETERNAL
HEART
BEAT,
WHERE
ELSE
BUT
IN
ONE'S
OWN
SELF,
IN
ITS
INNERMOST
PART,
IN
ITS
INDESTRUCTIBLE
PART,
WHICH
EVERYONE
HAD
IN
HIMSELF?
BUT
WHERE,
WHERE
WAS
THIS
SELF,
THIS
INNERMOST
PART,
THIS
ULTIMATE
PART?
IT
WAS
NOT
FLESH
AND
BONE,
IT
WAS
NEITHER
THOUGHT
NOR
CONSCIOUSNESS,
THUS
THE
WISEST
ONES
TAUGHT.
SO,
WHERE,
WHERE
WAS
IT?
TO
REACH
THIS
PLACE,
THE
SELF,
MYSELF,
THE
ATMAN,
THERE
WAS
ANOTHER
WAY,
WHICH
WAS
WORTHWHILE
LOOKING
FOR?
ALAS,
AND
NOBODY
SHOWED
THIS
WAY,
NOBODY
KNEW
IT,
NOT
THE
FATHER,
AND
NOT
THE
TEACHERS
AND
WISE
MEN,
NOT
THE
HOLY
SACRIFICIAL
SONGS!
THEY
KNEW
EVERYTHING,
THE
BRAHMANS
AND
THEIR
HOLY
BOOKS,
THEY
KNEW
EVERYTHING,
THEY
HAD
TAKEN
CARE
OF
EVERYTHING
AND
OF
MORE
THAN
EVERYTHING,
THE
CREATION
OF
THE
WORLD,
THE
ORIGIN
OF
SPEECH,
OF
FOOD,
OF
INHALING,
OF
EXHALING,
THE
ARRANGEMENT
OF
THE
SENSES,
THE
ACTS
OF
THE
GODS,
THEY
KNEW
INFINITELY
MUCH--BUT
WAS
IT
VALUABLE
TO
KNOW
ALL
OF
THIS,
NOT
KNOWING
THAT
ONE
AND
ONLY
THING,
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
THING,
THE
SOLELY
IMPORTANT
THING?
SURELY,
MANY
VERSES
OF
THE
HOLY
BOOKS,
PARTICULARLY
IN
THE
UPANISHADES
OF
SAMAVEDA,
SPOKE
OF
THIS
INNERMOST
AND
ULTIMATE
THING,
WONDERFUL
VERSES.
"YOUR
SOUL
IS
THE
WHOLE
WORLD",
WAS
WRITTEN
THERE,
AND
IT
WAS
WRITTEN
THAT
MAN
IN
HIS
SLEEP,
IN
HIS
DEEP
SLEEP,
WOULD
MEET
WITH
HIS
INNERMOST
PART
AND
WOULD
RESIDE
IN
THE
ATMAN.
MARVELLOUS
WISDOM
WAS
IN
THESE
VERSES,
ALL
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
WISEST
ONES
HAD
BEEN
COLLECTED
HERE
IN
MAGIC
WORDS,
PURE
AS
HONEY
COLLECTED
BY
BEES.
NO,
NOT
TO
BE
LOOKED
DOWN
UPON
WAS
THE
TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT
OF
ENLIGHTENMENT
WHICH
LAY
HERE
COLLECTED
AND
PRESERVED
BY
INNUMERABLE
GENERATIONS
OF
WISE
BRAHMANS.--
BUT
WHERE
WERE
THE
BRAHMANS,
WHERE
THE
PRIESTS,
WHERE
THE
WISE
MEN
OR
PENITENTS,
WHO
HAD
SUCCEEDED
IN
NOT
JUST
KNOWING
THIS
DEEPEST
OF
ALL
KNOWLEDGE
BUT
ALSO
TO
LIVE
IT?
WHERE
WAS
THE
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ONE
WHO
WOVE
HIS
SPELL
TO
BRING
HIS
FAMILIARITY
WITH
THE
ATMAN
OUT
OF
THE
SLEEP
INTO
THE
STATE
OF
BEING
AWAKE,
INTO
THE
LIFE,
INTO
EVERY
STEP
OF
THE
WAY,
INTO
WORD
AND
DEED?
SIDDHARTHA
KNEW
MANY
VENERABLE
BRAHMANS,
CHIEFLY
HIS
FATHER,
THE
PURE
ONE,
THE
SCHOLAR,
THE
MOST
VENERABLE
ONE.
HIS
FATHER
WAS
TO
BE
ADMIRED,
QUIET
AND
NOBLE
WERE
HIS
MANNERS,
PURE
HIS
LIFE,
WISE
HIS
WORDS,
DELICATE
AND
NOBLE
THOUGHTS
LIVED
BEHIND
ITS
BROW
--BUT
EVEN
HE,
WHO
KNEW
SO
MUCH,
DID
HE
LIVE
IN
BLISSFULNESS,
DID
HE
HAVE
PEACE,
WAS
HE
NOT
ALSO
JUST
A
SEARCHING
MAN,
A
THIRSTY
MAN?
DID
HE
NOT,
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN,
HAVE
TO
DRINK
FROM
HOLY
SOURCES,
AS
A
THIRSTY
MAN,
FROM
THE
OFFERINGS,
FROM
THE
BOOKS,
FROM
THE
DISPUTES
OF
THE
BRAHMANS?
WHY
DID
HE,
THE
IRREPROACHABLE
ONE,
HAVE
TO
WASH
OFF
SINS
EVERY
DAY,
STRIVE
FOR
A
CLEANSING
EVERY
DAY,
OVER
AND
OVER
EVERY
DAY?
WAS
NOT
ATMAN
IN
HIM,
DID
NOT
THE
PRISTINE
SOURCE
SPRING
FROM
HIS
HEART?
IT
HAD
TO
BE
FOUND,
THE
PRISTINE
SOURCE
IN
ONE'S
OWN
SELF,
IT
HAD
TO
BE
POSSESSED!
EVERYTHING
ELSE
WAS
SEARCHING,
WAS
A
DETOUR,
WAS
GETTING
LOST.
THUS
WERE
SIDDHARTHA'S
THOUGHTS,
THIS
WAS
HIS
THIRST,
THIS
WAS
HIS
SUFFERING.
OFTEN
HE
SPOKE
TO
HIMSELF
FROM
A
CHANDOGYA-UPANISHAD
THE
WORDS:
"TRULY,
THE
NAME
OF
THE
BRAHMAN
IS
SATYAM--VERILY,
HE
WHO
KNOWS
SUCH
A
THING,
WILL
ENTER
THE
HEAVENLY
WORLD
EVERY
DAY."
OFTEN,
IT
SEEMED
NEAR,
THE
HEAVENLY
WORLD,
BUT
NEVER
HE
HAD
REACHED
IT
COMPLETELY,
NEVER
HE
HAD
QUENCHED
THE
ULTIMATE
THIRST.
AND
AMONG
ALL
THE
WISE
AND
WISEST
MEN,
HE
KNEW
AND
WHOSE
INSTRUCTIONS
HE
HAD
RECEIVED,
AMONG
ALL
OF
THEM
THERE
WAS
NO
ONE,
WHO
HAD
REACHED
IT
COMPLETELY,
THE
HEAVENLY
WORLD,
WHO
HAD
QUENCHED
IT
COMPLETELY,
THE
ETERNAL
THIRST.
"GOVINDA,"
SIDDHARTHA
SPOKE
TO
HIS
FRIEND,
"GOVINDA,
MY
DEAR,
COME
WITH
ME
UNDER
THE
BANYAN
TREE,
LET'S
PRACTISE
MEDITATION."
THEY
WENT
TO
THE
BANYAN
TREE,
THEY
SAT
DOWN,
SIDDHARTHA
RIGHT
HERE,
GOVINDA
TWENTY
PACES
AWAY.
WHILE
PUTTING
HIMSELF
DOWN,
READY
TO
SPEAK
THE
OM,
SIDDHARTHA
REPEATED
MURMURING
THE
VERSE:
OM
IS
THE
BOW,
THE
ARROW
IS
SOUL,
THE
BRAHMAN
IS
THE
ARROW'S
TARGET,
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
INCESSANTLY
HIT.
AFTER
THE
USUAL
TIME
OF
THE
EXERCISE
IN
MEDITATION
HAD
PASSED,
GOVINDA
ROSE.
THE
EVENING
HAD
COME,
IT
WAS
TIME
TO
PERFORM
THE
EVENING'S
ABLUTION.
HE
CALLED
SIDDHARTHA'S
NAME.
SIDDHARTHA
DID
NOT
ANSWER.
SIDDHARTHA
SAT
THERE
LOST
IN
THOUGHT,
HIS
EYES
WERE
RIGIDLY
FOCUSED
TOWARDS
A
VERY
DISTANT
TARGET,
THE
TIP
OF
HIS
TONGUE
WAS
PROTRUDING
A
LITTLE
BETWEEN
THE
TEETH,
HE
SEEMED
NOT
TO
BREATHE.
THUS
SAT
HE,
WRAPPED
UP
IN
CONTEMPLATION,
THINKING
OM,
HIS
SOUL
SENT
AFTER
THE
BRAHMAN
AS
AN
ARROW.
ONCE,
SAMANAS
HAD
TRAVELLED
THROUGH
SIDDHARTHA'S
TOWN,
ASCETICS
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE,
THREE
SKINNY,
WITHERED
MEN,
NEITHER
OLD
NOR
YOUNG,
WITH
DUSTY
AND
BLOODY
SHOULDERS,
ALMOST
NAKED,
SCORCHED
BY
THE
SUN,
SURROUNDED
BY
LONELINESS,
STRANGERS
AND
ENEMIES
TO
THE
WORLD,
STRANGERS
AND
LANK
JACKALS
IN
THE
REALM
OF
HUMANS.
BEHIND
THEM
BLEW
A
HOT
SCENT
OF
QUIET
PASSION,
OF
DESTRUCTIVE
SERVICE,
OF
MERCILESS
SELF-DENIAL.
IN
THE
EVENING,
AFTER
THE
HOUR
OF
CONTEMPLATION,
SIDDHARTHA
SPOKE
TO
GOVINDA:
"EARLY
TOMORROW
MORNING,
MY
FRIEND,
SIDDHARTHA
WILL
GO
TO
THE
SAMANAS.
HE
WILL
BECOME
A
SAMANA."
GOVINDA
TURNED
PALE,
WHEN
HE
HEARD
THESE
WORDS
AND
READ
THE
DECISION
IN
THE
MOTIONLESS
FACE
OF
HIS
FRIEND,
UNSTOPPABLE
LIKE
THE
ARROW
SHOT
FROM
THE
BOW.
SOON
AND
WITH
THE
FIRST
GLANCE,
GOVINDA
REALIZED:
NOW
IT
IS
BEGINNING,
NOW
SIDDHARTHA
IS
TAKING
HIS
OWN
WAY,
NOW
HIS
FATE
IS
BEGINNING
TO
SPROUT,
AND
WITH
HIS,
MY
OWN.
AND
HE
TURNED
PALE
LIKE
A
DRY
BANANA-SKIN.
"O
SIDDHARTHA,"
HE
EXCLAIMED,
"WILL
YOUR
FATHER
PERMIT
YOU
TO
DO
THAT?"
SIDDHARTHA
LOOKED
OVER
AS
IF
HE
WAS
JUST
WAKING
UP.
ARROW-FAST
HE
READ
IN
GOVINDA'S
SOUL,
READ
THE
FEAR,
READ
THE
SUBMISSION.
"O
GOVINDA,"
HE
SPOKE
QUIETLY,
"LET'S
NOT
WASTE
WORDS.
TOMORROW,
AT
DAYBREAK
I
WILL
BEGIN
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
SAMANAS.
SPEAK
NO
MORE
OF
IT."
SIDDHARTHA
ENTERED
THE
CHAMBER,
WHERE
HIS
FATHER
WAS
SITTING
ON
A
MAT
OF
BAST,
AND
STEPPED
BEHIND
HIS
FATHER
AND
REMAINED
STANDING
THERE,
UNTIL
HIS
FATHER
FELT
THAT
SOMEONE
WAS
STANDING
BEHIND
HIM.
QUOTH
THE
BRAHMAN:
"IS
THAT
YOU,
SIDDHARTHA?
THEN
SAY
WHAT
YOU
CAME
TO
SAY."
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"WITH
YOUR
PERMISSION,
MY
FATHER.
I
CAME
TO
TELL
YOU
THAT
IT
IS
MY
LONGING
TO
LEAVE
YOUR
HOUSE
TOMORROW
AND
GO
TO
THE
ASCETICS.
MY
DESIRE
IS
TO
BECOME
A
SAMANA.
MAY
MY
FATHER
NOT
OPPOSE
THIS."
THE
BRAHMAN
FELL
SILENT,
AND
REMAINED
SILENT
FOR
SO
LONG
THAT
THE
STARS
IN
THE
SMALL
WINDOW
WANDERED
AND
CHANGED
THEIR
RELATIVE
POSITIONS,
'ERE
THE
SILENCE
WAS
BROKEN.
SILENT
AND
MOTIONLESS
STOOD
THE
SON
WITH
HIS
ARMS
FOLDED,
SILENT
AND
MOTIONLESS
SAT
THE
FATHER
ON
THE
MAT,
AND
THE
STARS
TRACED
THEIR
PATHS
IN
THE
SKY.
THEN
SPOKE
THE
FATHER:
"NOT
PROPER
IT
IS
FOR
A
BRAHMAN
TO
SPEAK
HARSH
AND
ANGRY
WORDS.
BUT
INDIGNATION
IS
IN
MY
HEART.
I
WISH
NOT
TO
HEAR
THIS
REQUEST
FOR
A
SECOND
TIME
FROM
YOUR
MOUTH."
SLOWLY,
THE
BRAHMAN
ROSE;
SIDDHARTHA
STOOD
SILENTLY,
HIS
ARMS
FOLDED.
"WHAT
ARE
YOU
WAITING
FOR?"
ASKED
THE
FATHER.
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"YOU
KNOW
WHAT."
INDIGNANT,
THE
FATHER
LEFT
THE
CHAMBER;
INDIGNANT,
HE
WENT
TO
HIS
BED
AND
LAY
DOWN.
AFTER
AN
HOUR,
SINCE
NO
SLEEP
HAD
COME
OVER
HIS
EYES,
THE
BRAHMAN
STOOD
UP,
PACED
TO
AND
FRO,
AND
LEFT
THE
HOUSE.
THROUGH
THE
SMALL
WINDOW
OF
THE
CHAMBER
HE
LOOKED
BACK
INSIDE,
AND
THERE
HE
SAW
SIDDHARTHA
STANDING,
HIS
ARMS
FOLDED,
NOT
MOVING
FROM
HIS
SPOT.
PALE
SHIMMERED
HIS
BRIGHT
ROBE.
WITH
ANXIETY
IN
HIS
HEART,
THE
FATHER
RETURNED
TO
HIS
BED.
AFTER
ANOTHER
HOUR,
SINCE
NO
SLEEP
HAD
COME
OVER
HIS
EYES,
THE
BRAHMAN
STOOD
UP
AGAIN,
PACED
TO
AND
FRO,
WALKED
OUT
OF
THE
HOUSE
AND
SAW
THAT
THE
MOON
HAD
RISEN.
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW
OF
THE
CHAMBER
HE
LOOKED
BACK
INSIDE;
THERE
STOOD
SIDDHARTHA,
NOT
MOVING
FROM
HIS
SPOT,
HIS
ARMS
FOLDED,
MOONLIGHT
REFLECTING
FROM
HIS
BARE
SHINS.
WITH
WORRY
IN
HIS
HEART,
THE
FATHER
WENT
BACK
TO
BED.
AND
HE
CAME
BACK
AFTER
AN
HOUR,
HE
CAME
BACK
AFTER
TWO
HOURS,
LOOKED
THROUGH
THE
SMALL
WINDOW,
SAW
SIDDHARTHA
STANDING,
IN
THE
MOON
LIGHT,
BY
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
STARS,
IN
THE
DARKNESS.
AND
HE
CAME
BACK
HOUR
AFTER
HOUR,
SILENTLY,
HE
LOOKED
INTO
THE
CHAMBER,
SAW
HIM
STANDING
IN
THE
SAME
PLACE,
FILLED
HIS
HEART
WITH
ANGER,
FILLED
HIS
HEART
WITH
UNREST,
FILLED
HIS
HEART
WITH
ANGUISH,
FILLED
IT
WITH
SADNESS.
AND
IN
THE
NIGHT'S
LAST
HOUR,
BEFORE
THE
DAY
BEGAN,
HE
RETURNED,
STEPPED
INTO
THE
ROOM,
SAW
THE
YOUNG
MAN
STANDING
THERE,
WHO
SEEMED
TALL
AND
LIKE
A
STRANGER
TO
HIM.
"SIDDHARTHA,"
HE
SPOKE,
"WHAT
ARE
YOU
WAITING
FOR?"
"YOU
KNOW
WHAT."
"WILL
YOU
ALWAYS
STAND
THAT
WAY
AND
WAIT,
UNTIL
IT'LL
BECOMES
MORNING,
NOON,
AND
EVENING?"
"I
WILL
STAND
AND
WAIT.
"YOU
WILL
BECOME
TIRED,
SIDDHARTHA."
"I
WILL
BECOME
TIRED."
"YOU
WILL
FALL
ASLEEP,
SIDDHARTHA."
"I
WILL
NOT
FALL
ASLEEP."
"YOU
WILL
DIE,
SIDDHARTHA."
"I
WILL
DIE."
"AND
WOULD
YOU
RATHER
DIE,
THAN
OBEY
YOUR
FATHER?"
"SIDDHARTHA
HAS
ALWAYS
OBEYED
HIS
FATHER."
"SO
WILL
YOU
ABANDON
YOUR
PLAN?"
"SIDDHARTHA
WILL
DO
WHAT
HIS
FATHER
WILL
TELL
HIM
TO
DO."
THE
FIRST
LIGHT
OF
DAY
SHONE
INTO
THE
ROOM.
THE
BRAHMAN
SAW
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
TREMBLING
SOFTLY
IN
HIS
KNEES.
IN
SIDDHARTHA'S
FACE
HE
SAW
NO
TREMBLING,
HIS
EYES
WERE
FIXED
ON
A
DISTANT
SPOT.
THEN
HIS
FATHER
REALIZED
THAT
EVEN
NOW
SIDDHARTHA
NO
LONGER
DWELT
WITH
HIM
IN
HIS
HOME,
THAT
HE
HAD
ALREADY
LEFT
HIM.
THE
FATHER
TOUCHED
SIDDHARTHA'S
SHOULDER.
"YOU
WILL,"
HE
SPOKE,
"GO
INTO
THE
FOREST
AND
BE
A
SAMANA.
WHEN
YOU'LL
HAVE
FOUND
BLISSFULNESS
IN
THE
FOREST,
THEN
COME
BACK
AND
TEACH
ME
TO
BE
BLISSFUL.
IF
YOU'LL
FIND
DISAPPOINTMENT,
THEN
RETURN
AND
LET
US
ONCE
AGAIN
MAKE
OFFERINGS
TO
THE
GODS
TOGETHER.
GO
NOW
AND
KISS
YOUR
MOTHER,
TELL
HER
WHERE
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO.
BUT
FOR
ME
IT
IS
TIME
TO
GO
TO
THE
RIVER
AND
TO
PERFORM
THE
FIRST
ABLUTION."
HE
TOOK
HIS
HAND
FROM
THE
SHOULDER
OF
HIS
SON
AND
WENT
OUTSIDE.
SIDDHARTHA
WAVERED
TO
THE
SIDE,
AS
HE
TRIED
TO
WALK.
HE
PUT
HIS
LIMBS
BACK
UNDER
CONTROL,
BOWED
TO
HIS
FATHER,
AND
WENT
TO
HIS
MOTHER
TO
DO
AS
HIS
FATHER
HAD
SAID.
AS
HE
SLOWLY
LEFT
ON
STIFF
LEGS
IN
THE
FIRST
LIGHT
OF
DAY
THE
STILL
QUIET
TOWN,
A
SHADOW
ROSE
NEAR
THE
LAST
HUT,
WHO
HAD
CROUCHED
THERE,
AND
JOINED
THE
PILGRIM--GOVINDA.
"YOU
HAVE
COME,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA
AND
SMILED.
"I
HAVE
COME,"
SAID
GOVINDA.
WITH
THE
SAMANAS
IN
THE
EVENING
OF
THIS
DAY
THEY
CAUGHT
UP
WITH
THE
ASCETICS,
THE
SKINNY
SAMANAS,
AND
OFFERED
THEM
THEIR
COMPANIONSHIP
AND--OBEDIENCE.
THEY
WERE
ACCEPTED.
SIDDHARTHA
GAVE
HIS
GARMENTS
TO
A
POOR
BRAHMAN
IN
THE
STREET.
HE
WORE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
THE
LOINCLOTH
AND
THE
EARTH-COLOURED,
UNSOWN
CLOAK.
HE
ATE
ONLY
ONCE
A
DAY,
AND
NEVER
SOMETHING
COOKED.
HE
FASTED
FOR
FIFTEEN
DAYS.
HE
FASTED
FOR
TWENTY-EIGHT
DAYS.
THE
FLESH
WANED
FROM
HIS
THIGHS
AND
CHEEKS.
FEVERISH
DREAMS
FLICKERED
FROM
HIS
ENLARGED
EYES,
LONG
NAILS
GREW
SLOWLY
ON
HIS
PARCHED
FINGERS
AND
A
DRY,
SHAGGY
BEARD
GREW
ON
HIS
CHIN.
HIS
GLANCE
TURNED
TO
ICE
WHEN
HE
ENCOUNTERED
WOMEN;
HIS
MOUTH
TWITCHED
WITH
CONTEMPT,
WHEN
HE
WALKED
THROUGH
A
CITY
OF
NICELY
DRESSED
PEOPLE.
HE
SAW
MERCHANTS
TRADING,
PRINCES
HUNTING,
MOURNERS
WAILING
FOR
THEIR
DEAD,
WHORES
OFFERING
THEMSELVES,
PHYSICIANS
TRYING
TO
HELP
THE
SICK,
PRIESTS
DETERMINING
THE
MOST
SUITABLE
DAY
FOR
SEEDING,
LOVERS
LOVING,
MOTHERS
NURSING
THEIR
CHILDREN--AND
ALL
OF
THIS
WAS
NOT
WORTHY
OF
ONE
LOOK
FROM
HIS
EYE,
IT
ALL
LIED,
IT
ALL
STANK,
IT
ALL
STANK
OF
LIES,
IT
ALL
PRETENDED
TO
BE
MEANINGFUL
AND
JOYFUL
AND
BEAUTIFUL,
AND
IT
ALL
WAS
JUST
CONCEALED
PUTREFACTION.
THE
WORLD
TASTED
BITTER.
LIFE
WAS
TORTURE.
A
GOAL
STOOD
BEFORE
SIDDHARTHA,
A
SINGLE
GOAL:
TO
BECOME
EMPTY,
EMPTY
OF
THIRST,
EMPTY
OF
WISHING,
EMPTY
OF
DREAMS,
EMPTY
OF
JOY
AND
SORROW.
DEAD
TO
HIMSELF,
NOT
TO
BE
A
SELF
ANY
MORE,
TO
FIND
TRANQUILITY
WITH
AN
EMPTIED
HEARD,
TO
BE
OPEN
TO
MIRACLES
IN
UNSELFISH
THOUGHTS,
THAT
WAS
HIS
GOAL.
ONCE
ALL
OF
MY
SELF
WAS
OVERCOME
AND
HAD
DIED,
ONCE
EVERY
DESIRE
AND
EVERY
URGE
WAS
SILENT
IN
THE
HEART,
THEN
THE
ULTIMATE
PART
OF
ME
HAD
TO
AWAKE,
THE
INNERMOST
OF
MY
BEING,
WHICH
IS
NO
LONGER
MY
SELF,
THE
GREAT
SECRET.
SILENTLY,
SIDDHARTHA
EXPOSED
HIMSELF
TO
BURNING
RAYS
OF
THE
SUN
DIRECTLY
ABOVE,
GLOWING
WITH
PAIN,
GLOWING
WITH
THIRST,
AND
STOOD
THERE,
UNTIL
HE
NEITHER
FELT
ANY
PAIN
NOR
THIRST
ANY
MORE.
SILENTLY,
HE
STOOD
THERE
IN
THE
RAINY
SEASON,
FROM
HIS
HAIR
THE
WATER
WAS
DRIPPING
OVER
FREEZING
SHOULDERS,
OVER
FREEZING
HIPS
AND
LEGS,
AND
THE
PENITENT
STOOD
THERE,
UNTIL
HE
COULD
NOT
FEEL
THE
COLD
IN
HIS
SHOULDERS
AND
LEGS
ANY
MORE,
UNTIL
THEY
WERE
SILENT,
UNTIL
THEY
WERE
QUIET.
SILENTLY,
HE
COWERED
IN
THE
THORNY
BUSHES,
BLOOD
DRIPPED
FROM
THE
BURNING
SKIN,
FROM
FESTERING
WOUNDS
DRIPPED
PUS,
AND
SIDDHARTHA
STAYED
RIGIDLY,
STAYED
MOTIONLESS,
UNTIL
NO
BLOOD
FLOWED
ANY
MORE,
UNTIL
NOTHING
STUNG
ANY
MORE,
UNTIL
NOTHING
BURNED
ANY
MORE.
SIDDHARTHA
SAT
UPRIGHT
AND
LEARNED
TO
BREATHE
SPARINGLY,
LEARNED
TO
GET
ALONG
WITH
ONLY
FEW
BREATHES,
LEARNED
TO
STOP
BREATHING.
HE
LEARNED,
BEGINNING
WITH
THE
BREATH,
TO
CALM
THE
BEAT
OF
HIS
HEART,
LEANED
TO
REDUCE
THE
BEATS
OF
HIS
HEART,
UNTIL
THEY
WERE
ONLY
A
FEW
AND
ALMOST
NONE.
INSTRUCTED
BY
THE
OLDEST
IF
THE
SAMANAS,
SIDDHARTHA
PRACTISED
SELF-DENIAL,
PRACTISED
MEDITATION,
ACCORDING
TO
A
NEW
SAMANA
RULES.
A
HERON
FLEW
OVER
THE
BAMBOO
FOREST--AND
SIDDHARTHA
ACCEPTED
THE
HERON
INTO
HIS
SOUL,
FLEW
OVER
FOREST
AND
MOUNTAINS,
WAS
A
HERON,
ATE
FISH,
FELT
THE
PANGS
OF
A
HERON'S
HUNGER,
SPOKE
THE
HERON'S
CROAK,
DIED
A
HERON'S
DEATH.
A
DEAD
JACKAL
WAS
LYING
ON
THE
SANDY
BANK,
AND
SIDDHARTHA'S
SOUL
SLIPPED
INSIDE
THE
BODY,
WAS
THE
DEAD
JACKAL,
LAY
ON
THE
BANKS,
GOT
BLOATED,
STANK,
DECAYED,
WAS
DISMEMBERED
BY
HYAENAS,
WAS
SKINNED
BY
VULTURES,
TURNED
INTO
A
SKELETON,
TURNED
TO
DUST,
WAS
BLOWN
ACROSS
THE
FIELDS.
AND
SIDDHARTHA'S
SOUL
RETURNED,
HAD
DIED,
HAD
DECAYED,
WAS
SCATTERED
AS
DUST,
HAD
TASTED
THE
GLOOMY
INTOXICATION
OF
THE
CYCLE,
AWAITED
IN
NEW
THIRST
LIKE
A
HUNTER
IN
THE
GAP,
WHERE
HE
COULD
ESCAPE
FROM
THE
CYCLE,
WHERE
THE
END
OF
THE
CAUSES,
WHERE
AN
ETERNITY
WITHOUT
SUFFERING
BEGAN.
HE
KILLED
HIS
SENSES,
HE
KILLED
HIS
MEMORY,
HE
SLIPPED
OUT
OF
HIS
SELF
INTO
THOUSANDS
OF
OTHER
FORMS,
WAS
AN
ANIMAL,
WAS
CARRION,
WAS
STONE,
WAS
WOOD,
WAS
WATER,
AND
AWOKE
EVERY
TIME
TO
FIND
HIS
OLD
SELF
AGAIN,
SUN
SHONE
OR
MOON,
WAS
HIS
SELF
AGAIN,
TURNED
ROUND
IN
THE
CYCLE,
FELT
THIRST,
OVERCAME
THE
THIRST,
FELT
NEW
THIRST.
SIDDHARTHA
LEARNED
A
LOT
WHEN
HE
WAS
WITH
THE
SAMANAS,
MANY
WAYS
LEADING
AWAY
FROM
THE
SELF
HE
LEARNED
TO
GO.
HE
WENT
THE
WAY
OF
SELF-DENIAL
BY
MEANS
OF
PAIN,
THROUGH
VOLUNTARILY
SUFFERING
AND
OVERCOMING
PAIN,
HUNGER,
THIRST,
TIREDNESS.
HE
WENT
THE
WAY
OF
SELF-DENIAL
BY
MEANS
OF
MEDITATION,
THROUGH
IMAGINING
THE
MIND
TO
BE
VOID
OF
ALL
CONCEPTIONS.
THESE
AND
OTHER
WAYS
HE
LEARNED
TO
GO,
A
THOUSAND
TIMES
HE
LEFT
HIS
SELF,
FOR
HOURS
AND
DAYS
HE
REMAINED
IN
THE
NON-SELF.
BUT
THOUGH
THE
WAYS
LED
AWAY
FROM
THE
SELF,
THEIR
END
NEVERTHELESS
ALWAYS
LED
BACK
TO
THE
SELF.
THOUGH
SIDDHARTHA
FLED
FROM
THE
SELF
A
THOUSAND
TIMES,
STAYED
IN
NOTHINGNESS,
STAYED
IN
THE
ANIMAL,
IN
THE
STONE,
THE
RETURN
WAS
INEVITABLE,
INESCAPABLE
WAS
THE
HOUR,
WHEN
HE
FOUND
HIMSELF
BACK
IN
THE
SUNSHINE
OR
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT,
IN
THE
SHADE
OR
IN
THE
RAIN,
AND
WAS
ONCE
AGAIN
HIS
SELF
AND
SIDDHARTHA,
AND
AGAIN
FELT
THE
AGONY
OF
THE
CYCLE
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
FORCED
UPON
HIM.
BY
HIS
SIDE
LIVED
GOVINDA,
HIS
SHADOW,
WALKED
THE
SAME
PATHS,
UNDERTOOK
THE
SAME
EFFORTS.
THEY
RARELY
SPOKE
TO
ONE
ANOTHER,
THAN
THE
SERVICE
AND
THE
EXERCISES
REQUIRED.
OCCASIONALLY
THE
TWO
OF
THEM
WENT
THROUGH
THE
VILLAGES,
TO
BEG
FOR
FOOD
FOR
THEMSELVES
AND
THEIR
TEACHERS.
"HOW
DO
YOU
THINK,
GOVINDA,"
SIDDHARTHA
SPOKE
ONE
DAY
WHILE
BEGGING
THIS
WAY,
"HOW
DO
YOU
THINK
DID
WE
PROGRESS?
DID
WE
REACH
ANY
GOALS?"
GOVINDA
ANSWERED:
"WE
HAVE
LEARNED,
AND
WE'LL
CONTINUE
LEARNING.
YOU'LL
BE
A
GREAT
SAMANA,
SIDDHARTHA.
QUICKLY,
YOU'VE
LEARNED
EVERY
EXERCISE,
OFTEN
THE
OLD
SAMANAS
HAVE
ADMIRED
YOU.
ONE
DAY,
YOU'LL
BE
A
HOLY
MAN,
OH
SIDDHARTHA."
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"I
CAN'T
HELP
BUT
FEEL
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
LIKE
THIS,
MY
FRIEND.
WHAT
I'VE
LEARNED,
BEING
AMONG
THE
SAMANAS,
UP
TO
THIS
DAY,
THIS,
OH
GOVINDA,
I
COULD
HAVE
LEARNED
MORE
QUICKLY
AND
BY
SIMPLER
MEANS.
IN
EVERY
TAVERN
OF
THAT
PART
OF
A
TOWN
WHERE
THE
WHOREHOUSES
ARE,
MY
FRIEND,
AMONG
CARTERS
AND
GAMBLERS
I
COULD
HAVE
LEARNED
IT."
QUOTH
GOVINDA:
"SIDDHARTHA
IS
PUTTING
ME
ON.
HOW
COULD
YOU
HAVE
LEARNED
MEDITATION,
HOLDING
YOUR
BREATH,
INSENSITIVITY
AGAINST
HUNGER
AND
PAIN
THERE
AMONG
THESE
WRETCHED
PEOPLE?"
AND
SIDDHARTHA
SAID
QUIETLY,
AS
IF
HE
WAS
TALKING
TO
HIMSELF:
"WHAT
IS
MEDITATION?
WHAT
IS
LEAVING
ONE'S
BODY?
WHAT
IS
FASTING?
WHAT
IS
HOLDING
ONE'S
BREATH?
IT
IS
FLEEING
FROM
THE
SELF,
IT
IS
A
SHORT
ESCAPE
OF
THE
AGONY
OF
BEING
A
SELF,
IT
IS
A
SHORT
NUMBING
OF
THE
SENSES
AGAINST
THE
PAIN
AND
THE
POINTLESSNESS
OF
LIFE.
THE
SAME
ESCAPE,
THE
SAME
SHORT
NUMBING
IS
WHAT
THE
DRIVER
OF
AN
OX-CART
FINDS
IN
THE
INN,
DRINKING
A
FEW
BOWLS
OF
RICE-WINE
OR
FERMENTED
COCONUT-MILK.
THEN
HE
WON'T
FEEL
HIS
SELF
ANY
MORE,
THEN
HE
WON'T
FEEL
THE
PAINS
OF
LIFE
ANY
MORE,
THEN
HE
FINDS
A
SHORT
NUMBING
OF
THE
SENSES.
WHEN
HE
FALLS
ASLEEP
OVER
HIS
BOWL
OF
RICE-WINE,
HE'LL
FIND
THE
SAME
WHAT
SIDDHARTHA
AND
GOVINDA
FIND
WHEN
THEY
ESCAPE
THEIR
BODIES
THROUGH
LONG
EXERCISES,
STAYING
IN
THE
NON-SELF.
THIS
IS
HOW
IT
IS,
OH
GOVINDA."
QUOTH
GOVINDA:
"YOU
SAY
SO,
OH
FRIEND,
AND
YET
YOU
KNOW
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
IS
NO
DRIVER
OF
AN
OX-CART
AND
A
SAMANA
IS
NO
DRUNKARD.
IT'S
TRUE
THAT
A
DRINKER
NUMBS
HIS
SENSES,
IT'S
TRUE
THAT
HE
BRIEFLY
ESCAPES
AND
RESTS,
BUT
HE'LL
RETURN
FROM
THE
DELUSION,
FINDS
EVERYTHING
TO
BE
UNCHANGED,
HAS
NOT
BECOME
WISER,
HAS
GATHERED
NO
ENLIGHTENMENT,--HAS
NOT
RISEN
SEVERAL
STEPS."
AND
SIDDHARTHA
SPOKE
WITH
A
SMILE:
"I
DO
NOT
KNOW,
I'VE
NEVER
BEEN
A
DRUNKARD.
BUT
THAT
I,
SIDDHARTHA,
FIND
ONLY
A
SHORT
NUMBING
OF
THE
SENSES
IN
MY
EXERCISES
AND
MEDITATIONS
AND
THAT
I
AM
JUST
AS
FAR
REMOVED
FROM
WISDOM,
FROM
SALVATION,
AS
A
CHILD
IN
THE
MOTHER'S
WOMB,
THIS
I
KNOW,
OH
GOVINDA,
THIS
I
KNOW."
AND
ONCE
AGAIN,
ANOTHER
TIME,
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
LEFT
THE
FOREST
TOGETHER
WITH
GOVINDA,
TO
BEG
FOR
SOME
FOOD
IN
THE
VILLAGE
FOR
THEIR
BROTHERS
AND
TEACHERS,
SIDDHARTHA
BEGAN
TO
SPEAK
AND
SAID:
"WHAT
NOW,
OH
GOVINDA,
MIGHT
WE
BE
ON
THE
RIGHT
PATH?
MIGHT
WE
GET
CLOSER
TO
ENLIGHTENMENT?
MIGHT
WE
GET
CLOSER
TO
SALVATION?
OR
DO
WE
PERHAPS
LIVE
IN
A
CIRCLE--
WE,
WHO
HAVE
THOUGHT
WE
WERE
ESCAPING
THE
CYCLE?"
QUOTH
GOVINDA:
"WE
HAVE
LEARNED
A
LOT,
SIDDHARTHA,
THERE
IS
STILL
MUCH
TO
LEARN.
WE
ARE
NOT
GOING
AROUND
IN
CIRCLES,
WE
ARE
MOVING
UP,
THE
CIRCLE
IS
A
SPIRAL,
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
ASCENDED
MANY
A
LEVEL."
SIDDHARTHA
ANSWERED:
"HOW
OLD,
WOULD
YOU
THINK,
IS
OUR
OLDEST
SAMANA,
OUR
VENERABLE
TEACHER?"
QUOTH
GOVINDA:
"OUR
OLDEST
ONE
MIGHT
BE
ABOUT
SIXTY
YEARS
OF
AGE."
AND
SIDDHARTHA:
"HE
HAS
LIVED
FOR
SIXTY
YEARS
AND
HAS
NOT
REACHED
THE
NIRVANA.
HE'LL
TURN
SEVENTY
AND
EIGHTY,
AND
YOU
AND
ME,
WE
WILL
GROW
JUST
AS
OLD
AND
WILL
DO
OUR
EXERCISES,
AND
WILL
FAST,
AND
WILL
MEDITATE.
BUT
WE
WILL
NOT
REACH
THE
NIRVANA,
HE
WON'T
AND
WE
WON'T.
OH
GOVINDA,
I
BELIEVE
OUT
OF
ALL
THE
SAMANAS
OUT
THERE,
PERHAPS
NOT
A
SINGLE
ONE,
NOT
A
SINGLE
ONE,
WILL
REACH
THE
NIRVANA.
WE
FIND
COMFORT,
WE
FIND
NUMBNESS,
WE
LEARN
FEATS,
TO
DECEIVE
OTHERS.
BUT
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
THING,
THE
PATH
OF
PATHS,
WE
WILL
NOT
FIND."
"IF
YOU
ONLY,"
SPOKE
GOVINDA,
"WOULDN'T
SPEAK
SUCH
TERRIBLE
WORDS,
SIDDHARTHA!
HOW
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
AMONG
SO
MANY
LEARNED
MEN,
AMONG
SO
MANY
BRAHMANS,
AMONG
SO
MANY
AUSTERE
AND
VENERABLE
SAMANAS,
AMONG
SO
MANY
WHO
ARE
SEARCHING,
SO
MANY
WHO
ARE
EAGERLY
TRYING,
SO
MANY
HOLY
MEN,
NO
ONE
WILL
FIND
THE
PATH
OF
PATHS?"
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
SAID
IN
A
VOICE
WHICH
CONTAINED
JUST
AS
MUCH
SADNESS
AS
MOCKERY,
WITH
A
QUIET,
A
SLIGHTLY
SAD,
A
SLIGHTLY
MOCKING
VOICE:
"SOON,
GOVINDA,
YOUR
FRIEND
WILL
LEAVE
THE
PATH
OF
THE
SAMANAS,
HE
HAS
WALKED
ALONG
YOUR
SIDE
FOR
SO
LONG.
I'M
SUFFERING
OF
THIRST,
OH
GOVINDA,
AND
ON
THIS
LONG
PATH
OF
A
SAMANA,
MY
THIRST
HAS
REMAINED
AS
STRONG
AS
EVER.
I
ALWAYS
THIRSTED
FOR
KNOWLEDGE,
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
FULL
OF
QUESTIONS.
I
HAVE
ASKED
THE
BRAHMANS,
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR,
AND
I
HAVE
ASKED
THE
HOLY
VEDAS,
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR,
AND
I
HAVE
ASKED
THE
DEVOTE
SAMANAS,
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR.
PERHAPS,
OH
GOVINDA,
IT
HAD
BEEN
JUST
AS
WELL,
HAD
BEEN
JUST
AS
SMART
AND
JUST
AS
PROFITABLE,
IF
I
HAD
ASKED
THE
HORNBILL-BIRD
OR
THE
CHIMPANZEE.
IT
TOOK
ME
A
LONG
TIME
AND
AM
NOT
FINISHED
LEARNING
THIS
YET,
OH
GOVINDA:
THAT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
BE
LEARNED!
THERE
IS
INDEED
NO
SUCH
THING,
SO
I
BELIEVE,
AS
WHAT
WE
REFER
TO
AS
`LEARNING'.
THERE
IS,
OH
MY
FRIEND,
JUST
ONE
KNOWLEDGE,
THIS
IS
EVERYWHERE,
THIS
IS
ATMAN,
THIS
IS
WITHIN
ME
AND
WITHIN
YOU
AND
WITHIN
EVERY
CREATURE.
AND
SO
I'M
STARTING
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
HAS
NO
WORSER
ENEMY
THAN
THE
DESIRE
TO
KNOW
IT,
THAN
LEARNING."
AT
THIS,
GOVINDA
STOPPED
ON
THE
PATH,
ROSE
HIS
HANDS,
AND
SPOKE:
"IF
YOU,
SIDDHARTHA,
ONLY
WOULD
NOT
BOTHER
YOUR
FRIEND
WITH
THIS
KIND
OF
TALK!
TRULY,
YOU
WORDS
STIR
UP
FEAR
IN
MY
HEART.
AND
JUST
CONSIDER:
WHAT
WOULD
BECOME
OF
THE
SANCTITY
OF
PRAYER,
WHAT
OF
THE
VENERABILITY
OF
THE
BRAHMANS'
CASTE,
WHAT
OF
THE
HOLINESS
OF
THE
SAMANAS,
IF
IT
WAS
AS
YOU
SAY,
IF
THERE
WAS
NO
LEARNING?!
WHAT,
OH
SIDDHARTHA,
WHAT
WOULD
THEN
BECOME
OF
ALL
OF
THIS
WHAT
IS
HOLY,
WHAT
IS
PRECIOUS,
WHAT
IS
VENERABLE
ON
EARTH?!"
AND
GOVINDA
MUMBLED
A
VERSE
TO
HIMSELF,
A
VERSE
FROM
AN
UPANISHAD:
HE
WHO
PONDERINGLY,
OF
A
PURIFIED
SPIRIT,
LOSES
HIMSELF
IN
THE
MEDITATION
OF
ATMAN,
UNEXPRESSABLE
BY
WORDS
IS
HIS
BLISSFULNESS
OF
HIS
HEART.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
REMAINED
SILENT.
HE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
THE
WORDS
WHICH
GOVINDA
HAD
SAID
TO
HIM
AND
THOUGHT
THE
WORDS
THROUGH
TO
THEIR
END.
YES,
HE
THOUGHT,
STANDING
THERE
WITH
HIS
HEAD
LOW,
WHAT
WOULD
REMAIN
OF
ALL
THAT
WHICH
SEEMED
TO
US
TO
BE
HOLY?
WHAT
REMAINS?
WHAT
CAN
STAND
THE
TEST?
AND
HE
SHOOK
HIS
HEAD.
AT
ONE
TIME,
WHEN
THE
TWO
YOUNG
MEN
HAD
LIVED
AMONG
THE
SAMANAS
FOR
ABOUT
THREE
YEARS
AND
HAD
SHARED
THEIR
EXERCISES,
SOME
NEWS,
A
RUMOUR,
A
MYTH
REACHED
THEM
AFTER
BEING
RETOLD
MANY
TIMES:
A
MAN
HAD
APPEARED,
GOTAMA
BY
NAME,
THE
EXALTED
ONE,
THE
BUDDHA,
HE
HAD
OVERCOME
THE
SUFFERING
OF
THE
WORLD
IN
HIMSELF
AND
HAD
HALTED
THE
CYCLE
OF
REBIRTHS.
HE
WAS
SAID
TO
WANDER
THROUGH
THE
LAND,
TEACHING,
SURROUNDED
BY
DISCIPLES,
WITHOUT
POSSESSION,
WITHOUT
HOME,
WITHOUT
A
WIFE,
IN
THE
YELLOW
CLOAK
OF
AN
ASCETIC,
BUT
WITH
A
CHEERFUL
BROW,
A
MAN
OF
BLISS,
AND
BRAHMANS
AND
PRINCES
WOULD
BOW
DOWN
BEFORE
HIM
AND
WOULD
BECOME
HIS
STUDENTS.
THIS
MYTH,
THIS
RUMOUR,
THIS
LEGEND
RESOUNDED,
ITS
FRAGRANTS
ROSE
UP,
HERE
AND
THERE;
IN
THE
TOWNS,
THE
BRAHMANS
SPOKE
OF
IT
AND
IN
THE
FOREST,
THE
SAMANAS;
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN,
THE
NAME
OF
GOTAMA,
THE
BUDDHA
REACHED
THE
EARS
OF
THE
YOUNG
MEN,
WITH
GOOD
AND
WITH
BAD
TALK,
WITH
PRAISE
AND
WITH
DEFAMATION.
IT
WAS
AS
IF
THE
PLAGUE
HAD
BROKEN
OUT
IN
A
COUNTRY
AND
NEWS
HAD
BEEN
SPREADING
AROUND
THAT
IN
ONE
OR
ANOTHER
PLACE
THERE
WAS
A
MAN,
A
WISE
MAN,
A
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ONE,
WHOSE
WORD
AND
BREATH
WAS
ENOUGH
TO
HEAL
EVERYONE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
INFECTED
WITH
THE
PESTILENCE,
AND
AS
SUCH
NEWS
WOULD
GO
THROUGH
THE
LAND
AND
EVERYONE
WOULD
TALK
ABOUT
IT,
MANY
WOULD
BELIEVE,
MANY
WOULD
DOUBT,
BUT
MANY
WOULD
GET
ON
THEIR
WAY
AS
SOON
AS
POSSIBLE,
TO
SEEK
THE
WISE
MAN,
THE
HELPER,
JUST
LIKE
THIS
THIS
MYTH
RAN
THROUGH
THE
LAND,
THAT
FRAGRANT
MYTH
OF
GOTAMA,
THE
BUDDHA,
THE
WISE
MAN
OF
THE
FAMILY
OF
SAKYA.
HE
POSSESSED,
SO
THE
BELIEVERS
SAID,
THE
HIGHEST
ENLIGHTENMENT,
HE
REMEMBERED
HIS
PREVIOUS
LIVES,
HE
HAD
REACHED
THE
NIRVANA
AND
NEVER
RETURNED
INTO
THE
CYCLE,
WAS
NEVER
AGAIN
SUBMERGED
IN
THE
MURKY
RIVER
OF
PHYSICAL
FORMS.
MANY
WONDERFUL
AND
UNBELIEVABLE
THINGS
WERE
REPORTED
OF
HIM,
HE
HAD
PERFORMED
MIRACLES,
HAD
OVERCOME
THE
DEVIL,
HAD
SPOKEN
TO
THE
GODS.
BUT
HIS
ENEMIES
AND
DISBELIEVERS
SAID,
THIS
GOTAMA
WAS
A
VAIN
SEDUCER,
HE
WOULD
SPENT
HIS
DAYS
IN
LUXURY,
SCORNED
THE
OFFERINGS,
WAS
WITHOUT
LEARNING,
AND
KNEW
NEITHER
EXERCISES
NOR
SELF-CASTIGATION.
THE
MYTH
OF
BUDDHA
SOUNDED
SWEET.
THE
SCENT
OF
MAGIC
FLOWED
FROM
THESE
REPORTS.
AFTER
ALL,
THE
WORLD
WAS
SICK,
LIFE
WAS
HARD
TO
BEAR--AND
BEHOLD,
HERE
A
SOURCE
SEEMED
TO
SPRING
FORTH,
HERE
A
MESSENGER
SEEMED
TO
CALL
OUT,
COMFORTING,
MILD,
FULL
OF
NOBLE
PROMISES.
EVERYWHERE
WHERE
THE
RUMOUR
OF
BUDDHA
WAS
HEARD,
EVERYWHERE
IN
THE
LANDS
OF
INDIA,
THE
YOUNG
MEN
LISTENED
UP,
FELT
A
LONGING,
FELT
HOPE,
AND
AMONG
THE
BRAHMANS'
SONS
OF
THE
TOWNS
AND
VILLAGES
EVERY
PILGRIM
AND
STRANGER
WAS
WELCOME,
WHEN
HE
BROUGHT
NEWS
OF
HIM,
THE
EXALTED
ONE,
THE
SAKYAMUNI.
THE
MYTH
HAD
ALSO
REACHED
THE
SAMANAS
IN
THE
FOREST,
AND
ALSO
SIDDHARTHA,
AND
ALSO
GOVINDA,
SLOWLY,
DROP
BY
DROP,
EVERY
DROP
LADEN
WITH
HOPE,
EVERY
DROP
LADEN
WITH
DOUBT.
THEY
RARELY
TALKED
ABOUT
IT,
BECAUSE
THE
OLDEST
ONE
OF
THE
SAMANAS
DID
NOT
LIKE
THIS
MYTH.
HE
HAD
HEARD
THAT
THIS
ALLEGED
BUDDHA
USED
TO
BE
AN
ASCETIC
BEFORE
AND
HAD
LIVED
IN
THE
FOREST,
BUT
HAD
THEN
TURNED
BACK
TO
LUXURY
AND
WORLDLY
PLEASURES,
AND
HE
HAD
NO
HIGH
OPINION
OF
THIS
GOTAMA.
"OH
SIDDHARTHA,"
GOVINDA
SPOKE
ONE
DAY
TO
HIS
FRIEND.
"TODAY,
I
WAS
IN
THE
VILLAGE,
AND
A
BRAHMAN
INVITED
ME
INTO
HIS
HOUSE,
AND
IN
HIS
HOUSE,
THERE
WAS
THE
SON
OF
A
BRAHMAN
FROM
MAGADHA,
WHO
HAS
SEEN
THE
BUDDHA
WITH
HIS
OWN
EYES
AND
HAS
HEARD
HIM
TEACH.
VERILY,
THIS
MADE
MY
CHEST
ACHE
WHEN
I
BREATHED,
AND
THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF:
IF
ONLY
I
WOULD
TOO,
IF
ONLY
WE
BOTH
WOULD
TOO,
SIDDHARTHA
AND
ME,
LIVE
TO
SEE
THE
HOUR
WHEN
WE
WILL
HEAR
THE
TEACHINGS
FROM
THE
MOUTH
OF
THIS
PERFECTED
MAN!
SPEAK,
FRIEND,
WOULDN'T
WE
WANT
TO
GO
THERE
TOO
AND
LISTEN
TO
THE
TEACHINGS
FROM
THE
BUDDHA'S
MOUTH?"
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"ALWAYS,
OH
GOVINDA,
I
HAD
THOUGHT,
GOVINDA
WOULD
STAY
WITH
THE
SAMANAS,
ALWAYS
I
HAD
BELIEVED
HIS
GOAL
WAS
TO
LIVE
TO
BE
SIXTY
AND
SEVENTY
YEARS
OF
AGE
AND
TO
KEEP
ON
PRACTISING
THOSE
FEATS
AND
EXERCISES,
WHICH
ARE
BECOMING
A
SAMANA.
BUT
BEHOLD,
I
HAD
NOT
KNOWN
GOVINDA
WELL
ENOUGH,
I
KNEW
LITTLE
OF
HIS
HEART.
SO
NOW
YOU,
MY
FAITHFUL
FRIEND,
WANT
TO
TAKE
A
NEW
PATH
AND
GO
THERE,
WHERE
THE
BUDDHA
SPREADS
HIS
TEACHINGS."
QUOTH
GOVINDA:
"YOU'RE
MOCKING
ME.
MOCK
ME
IF
YOU
LIKE,
SIDDHARTHA!
BUT
HAVE
YOU
NOT
ALSO
DEVELOPED
A
DESIRE,
AN
EAGERNESS,
TO
HEAR
THESE
TEACHINGS?
AND
HAVE
YOU
NOT
AT
ONE
TIME
SAID
TO
ME,
YOU
WOULD
NOT
WALK
THE
PATH
OF
THE
SAMANAS
FOR
MUCH
LONGER?"
AT
THIS,
SIDDHARTHA
LAUGHED
IN
HIS
VERY
OWN
MANNER,
IN
WHICH
HIS
VOICE
ASSUMED
A
TOUCH
OF
SADNESS
AND
A
TOUCH
OF
MOCKERY,
AND
SAID:
"WELL,
GOVINDA,
YOU'VE
SPOKEN
WELL,
YOU'VE
REMEMBERED
CORRECTLY.
IF
YOU
ONLY
REMEMBERED
THE
OTHER
THING
AS
WELL,
YOU'VE
HEARD
FROM
ME,
WHICH
IS
THAT
I
HAVE
GROWN
DISTRUSTFUL
AND
TIRED
AGAINST
TEACHINGS
AND
LEARNING,
AND
THAT
MY
FAITH
IN
WORDS,
WHICH
ARE
BROUGHT
TO
US
BY
TEACHERS,
IS
SMALL.
BUT
LET'S
DO
IT,
MY
DEAR,
I
AM
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
TO
THESE
TEACHINGS--THOUGH
IN
MY
HEART
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WE'VE
ALREADY
TASTED
THE
BEST
FRUIT
OF
THESE
TEACHINGS."
QUOTH
GOVINDA:
"YOUR
WILLINGNESS
DELIGHTS
MY
HEART.
BUT
TELL
ME,
HOW
SHOULD
THIS
BE
POSSIBLE?
HOW
SHOULD
THE
GOTAMA'S
TEACHINGS,
EVEN
BEFORE
WE
HAVE
HEARD
THEM,
HAVE
ALREADY
REVEALED
THEIR
BEST
FRUIT
TO
US?"
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"LET
US
EAT
THIS
FRUIT
AND
WAIT
FOR
THE
REST,
OH
GOVINDA!
BUT
THIS
FRUIT,
WHICH
WE
ALREADY
NOW
RECEIVED
THANKS
TO
THE
GOTAMA,
CONSISTED
IN
HIM
CALLING
US
AWAY
FROM
THE
SAMANAS!
WHETHER
HE
HAS
ALSO
OTHER
AND
BETTER
THINGS
TO
GIVE
US,
OH
FRIEND,
LET
US
AWAIT
WITH
CALM
HEARTS."
ON
THIS
VERY
SAME
DAY,
SIDDHARTHA
INFORMED
THE
OLDEST
ONE
OF
THE
SAMANAS
OF
HIS
DECISION,
THAT
HE
WANTED
TO
LEAVE
HIM.
HE
INFORMED
THE
OLDEST
ONE
WITH
ALL
THE
COURTESY
AND
MODESTY
BECOMING
TO
A
YOUNGER
ONE
AND
A
STUDENT.
BUT
THE
SAMANA
BECAME
ANGRY,
BECAUSE
THE
TWO
YOUNG
MEN
WANTED
TO
LEAVE
HIM,
AND
TALKED
LOUDLY
AND
USED
CRUDE
SWEARWORDS.
GOVINDA
WAS
STARTLED
AND
BECAME
EMBARRASSED.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
PUT
HIS
MOUTH
CLOSE
TO
GOVINDA'S
EAR
AND
WHISPERED
TO
HIM:
"NOW,
I
WANT
TO
SHOW
THE
OLD
MAN
THAT
I'VE
LEARNED
SOMETHING
FROM
HIM."
POSITIONING
HIMSELF
CLOSELY
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
SAMANA,
WITH
A
CONCENTRATED
SOUL,
HE
CAPTURED
THE
OLD
MAN'S
GLANCE
WITH
HIS
GLANCES,
DEPRIVED
HIM
OF
HIS
POWER,
MADE
HIM
MUTE,
TOOK
AWAY
HIS
FREE
WILL,
SUBDUED
HIM
UNDER
HIS
OWN
WILL,
COMMANDED
HIM,
TO
DO
SILENTLY,
WHATEVER
HE
DEMANDED
HIM
TO
DO.
THE
OLD
MAN
BECAME
MUTE,
HIS
EYES
BECAME
MOTIONLESS,
HIS
WILL
WAS
PARALYSED,
HIS
ARMS
WERE
HANGING
DOWN;
WITHOUT
POWER,
HE
HAD
FALLEN
VICTIM
TO
SIDDHARTHA'S
SPELL.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA'S
THOUGHTS
BROUGHT
THE
SAMANA
UNDER
THEIR
CONTROL,
HE
HAD
TO
CARRY
OUT,
WHAT
THEY
COMMANDED.
AND
THUS,
THE
OLD
MAN
MADE
SEVERAL
BOWS,
PERFORMED
GESTURES
OF
BLESSING,
SPOKE
STAMMERINGLY
A
GODLY
WISH
FOR
A
GOOD
JOURNEY.
AND
THE
YOUNG
MEN
RETURNED
THE
BOWS
WITH
THANKS,
RETURNED
THE
WISH,
WENT
ON
THEIR
WAY
WITH
SALUTATIONS.
ON
THE
WAY,
GOVINDA
SAID:
"OH
SIDDHARTHA,
YOU
HAVE
LEARNED
MORE
FROM
THE
SAMANAS
THAN
I
KNEW.
IT
IS
HARD,
IT
IS
VERY
HARD
TO
CAST
A
SPELL
ON
AN
OLD
SAMANA.
TRULY,
IF
YOU
HAD
STAYED
THERE,
YOU
WOULD
SOON
HAVE
LEARNED
TO
WALK
ON
WATER."
"I
DO
NOT
SEEK
TO
WALK
ON
WATER,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA.
"LET
OLD
SAMANAS
BE
CONTENT
WITH
SUCH
FEATS!"
GOTAMA
IN
THE
TOWN
OF
SAVATHI,
EVERY
CHILD
KNEW
THE
NAME
OF
THE
EXALTED
BUDDHA,
AND
EVERY
HOUSE
WAS
PREPARED
TO
FILL
THE
ALMS-DISH
OF
GOTAMA'S
DISCIPLES,
THE
SILENTLY
BEGGING
ONES.
NEAR
THE
TOWN
WAS
GOTAMA'S
FAVOURITE
PLACE
TO
STAY,
THE
GROVE
OF
JETAVANA,
WHICH
THE
RICH
MERCHANT
ANATHAPINDIKA,
AN
OBEDIENT
WORSHIPPER
OF
THE
EXALTED
ONE,
HAD
GIVEN
HIM
AND
HIS
PEOPLE
FOR
A
GIFT.
ALL
TALES
AND
ANSWERS,
WHICH
THE
TWO
YOUNG
ASCETICS
HAD
RECEIVED
IN
THEIR
SEARCH
FOR
GOTAMA'S
ABODE,
HAD
POINTED
THEM
TOWARDS
THIS
AREA.
AND
ARRIVING
AT
SAVATHI,
IN
THE
VERY
FIRST
HOUSE,
BEFORE
THE
DOOR
OF
WHICH
THEY
STOPPED
TO
BEG,
FOOD
HAS
BEEN
OFFERED
TO
THEM,
AND
THEY
ACCEPTED
THE
FOOD,
AND
SIDDHARTHA
ASKED
THE
WOMAN,
WHO
HANDED
THEM
THE
FOOD:
"WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW,
OH
CHARITABLE
ONE,
WHERE
THE
BUDDHA
DWELLS,
THE
MOST
VENERABLE
ONE,
FOR
WE
ARE
TWO
SAMANAS
FROM
THE
FOREST
AND
HAVE
COME,
TO
SEE
HIM,
THE
PERFECTED
ONE,
AND
TO
HEAR
THE
TEACHINGS
FROM
HIS
MOUTH."
QUOTH
THE
WOMAN:
"HERE,
YOU
HAVE
TRULY
COME
TO
THE
RIGHT
PLACE,
YOU
SAMANAS
FROM
THE
FOREST.
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW,
IN
JETAVANA,
IN
THE
GARDEN
OF
ANATHAPINDIKA
IS
WHERE
THE
EXALTED
ONE
DWELLS.
THERE
YOU
PILGRIMS
SHALL
SPENT
THE
NIGHT,
FOR
THERE
IS
ENOUGH
SPACE
FOR
THE
INNUMERABLE,
WHO
FLOCK
HERE,
TO
HEAR
THE
TEACHINGS
FROM
HIS
MOUTH."
THIS
MADE
GOVINDA
HAPPY,
AND
FULL
OF
JOY
HE
EXCLAIMED:
"WELL
SO,
THUS
WE
HAVE
REACHED
OUR
DESTINATION,
AND
OUR
PATH
HAS
COME
TO
AN
END!
BUT
TELL
US,
OH
MOTHER
OF
THE
PILGRIMS,
DO
YOU
KNOW
HIM,
THE
BUDDHA,
HAVE
YOU
SEEN
HIM
WITH
YOUR
OWN
EYES?"
QUOTH
THE
WOMAN:
"MANY
TIMES
I
HAVE
SEEN
HIM,
THE
EXALTED
ONE.
ON
MANY
DAYS,
I
HAVE
SEEN
HIM,
WALKING
THROUGH
THE
ALLEYS
IN
SILENCE,
WEARING
HIS
YELLOW
CLOAK,
PRESENTING
HIS
ALMS-DISH
IN
SILENCE
AT
THE
DOORS
OF
THE
HOUSES,
LEAVING
WITH
A
FILLED
DISH."
DELIGHTEDLY,
GOVINDA
LISTENED
AND
WANTED
TO
ASK
AND
HEAR
MUCH
MORE.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
URGED
HIM
TO
WALK
ON.
THEY
THANKED
AND
LEFT
AND
HARDLY
HAD
TO
ASK
FOR
DIRECTIONS,
FOR
RATHER
MANY
PILGRIMS
AND
MONKS
AS
WELL
FROM
GOTAMA'S
COMMUNITY
WERE
ON
THEIR
WAY
TO
THE
JETAVANA.
AND
SINCE
THEY
REACHED
IT
AT
NIGHT,
THERE
WERE
CONSTANT
ARRIVALS,
SHOUTS,
AND
TALK
OF
THOSE
WHO
SOUGHT
SHELTER
AND
GOT
IT.
THE
TWO
SAMANAS,
ACCUSTOMED
TO
LIFE
IN
THE
FOREST,
FOUND
QUICKLY
AND
WITHOUT
MAKING
ANY
NOISE
A
PLACE
TO
STAY
AND
RESTED
THERE
UNTIL
THE
MORNING.
AT
SUNRISE,
THEY
SAW
WITH
ASTONISHMENT
WHAT
A
LARGE
CROWD
OF
BELIEVERS
AND
CURIOUS
PEOPLE
HAD
SPENT
THE
NIGHT
HERE.
ON
ALL
PATHS
OF
THE
MARVELLOUS
GROVE,
MONKS
WALKED
IN
YELLOW
ROBES,
UNDER
THE
TREES
THEY
SAT
HERE
AND
THERE,
IN
DEEP
CONTEMPLATION--OR
IN
A
CONVERSATION
ABOUT
SPIRITUAL
MATTERS,
THE
SHADY
GARDENS
LOOKED
LIKE
A
CITY,
FULL
OF
PEOPLE,
BUSTLING
LIKE
BEES.
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
MONKS
WENT
OUT
WITH
THEIR
ALMS-DISH,
TO
COLLECT
FOOD
IN
TOWN
FOR
THEIR
LUNCH,
THE
ONLY
MEAL
OF
THE
DAY.
THE
BUDDHA
HIMSELF,
THE
ENLIGHTENED
ONE,
WAS
ALSO
IN
THE
HABIT
OF
TAKING
THIS
WALK
TO
BEG
IN
THE
MORNING.
SIDDHARTHA
SAW
HIM,
AND
HE
INSTANTLY
RECOGNISED
HIM,
AS
IF
A
GOD
HAD
POINTED
HIM
OUT
TO
HIM.
HE
SAW
HIM,
A
SIMPLE
MAN
IN
A
YELLOW
ROBE,
BEARING
THE
ALMS-DISH
IN
HIS
HAND,
WALKING
SILENTLY.
"LOOK
HERE!"
SIDDHARTHA
SAID
QUIETLY
TO
GOVINDA.
"THIS
ONE
IS
THE
BUDDHA."
ATTENTIVELY,
GOVINDA
LOOKED
AT
THE
MONK
IN
THE
YELLOW
ROBE,
WHO
SEEMED
TO
BE
IN
NO
WAY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
HUNDREDS
OF
OTHER
MONKS.
AND
SOON,
GOVINDA
ALSO
REALIZED:
THIS
IS
THE
ONE.
AND
THEY
FOLLOWED
HIM
AND
OBSERVED
HIM.
THE
BUDDHA
WENT
ON
HIS
WAY,
MODESTLY
AND
DEEP
IN
HIS
THOUGHTS,
HIS
CALM
FACE
WAS
NEITHER
HAPPY
NOR
SAD,
IT
SEEMED
TO
SMILE
QUIETLY
AND
INWARDLY.
WITH
A
HIDDEN
SMILE,
QUIET,
CALM,
SOMEWHAT
RESEMBLING
A
HEALTHY
CHILD,
THE
BUDDHA
WALKED,
WORE
THE
ROBE
AND
PLACED
HIS
FEET
JUST
AS
ALL
OF
HIS
MONKS
DID,
ACCORDING
TO
A
PRECISE
RULE.
BUT
HIS
FACE
AND
HIS
WALK,
HIS
QUIETLY
LOWERED
GLANCE,
HIS
QUIETLY
DANGLING
HAND
AND
EVEN
EVERY
FINGER
OF
HIS
QUIETLY
DANGLING
HAND
EXPRESSED
PEACE,
EXPRESSED
PERFECTION,
DID
NOT
SEARCH,
DID
NOT
IMITATE,
BREATHED
SOFTLY
IN
AN
UNWHITHERING
CALM,
IN
AN
UNWHITHERING
LIGHT,
AN
UNTOUCHABLE
PEACE.
THUS
GOTAMA
WALKED
TOWARDS
THE
TOWN,
TO
COLLECT
ALMS,
AND
THE
TWO
SAMANAS
RECOGNISED
HIM
SOLELY
BY
THE
PERFECTION
OF
HIS
CALM,
BY
THE
QUIETNESS
OF
HIS
APPEARANCE,
IN
WHICH
THERE
WAS
NO
SEARCHING,
NO
DESIRE,
NO
IMITATION,
NO
EFFORT
TO
BE
SEEN,
ONLY
LIGHT
AND
PEACE.
"TODAY,
WE'LL
HEAR
THE
TEACHINGS
FROM
HIS
MOUTH."
SAID
GOVINDA.
SIDDHARTHA
DID
NOT
ANSWER.
HE
FELT
LITTLE
CURIOSITY
FOR
THE
TEACHINGS,
HE
DID
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
TEACH
HIM
ANYTHING
NEW,
BUT
HE
HAD,
JUST
AS
GOVINDA
HAD,
HEARD
THE
CONTENTS
OF
THIS
BUDDHA'S
TEACHINGS
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN,
THOUGH
THESE
REPORTS
ONLY
REPRESENTED
SECOND-
OR
THIRD-HAND
INFORMATION.
BUT
ATTENTIVELY
HE
LOOKED
AT
GOTAMA'S
HEAD,
HIS
SHOULDERS,
HIS
FEET,
HIS
QUIETLY
DANGLING
HAND,
AND
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM
AS
IF
EVERY
JOINT
OF
EVERY
FINGER
OF
THIS
HAND
WAS
OF
THESE
TEACHINGS,
SPOKE
OF,
BREATHED
OF,
EXHALED
THE
FRAGRANT
OF,
GLISTENED
OF
TRUTH.
THIS
MAN,
THIS
BUDDHA
WAS
TRUTHFUL
DOWN
TO
THE
GESTURE
OF
HIS
LAST
FINGER.
THIS
MAN
WAS
HOLY.
NEVER
BEFORE,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
VENERATED
A
PERSON
SO
MUCH,
NEVER
BEFORE
HE
HAD
LOVED
A
PERSON
AS
MUCH
AS
THIS
ONE.
THEY
BOTH
FOLLOWED
THE
BUDDHA
UNTIL
THEY
REACHED
THE
TOWN
AND
THEN
RETURNED
IN
SILENCE,
FOR
THEY
THEMSELVES
INTENDED
TO
ABSTAIN
FROM
ON
THIS
DAY.
THEY
SAW
GOTAMA
RETURNING--WHAT
HE
ATE
COULD
NOT
EVEN
HAVE
SATISFIED
A
BIRD'S
APPETITE,
AND
THEY
SAW
HIM
RETIRING
INTO
THE
SHADE
OF
THE
MANGO-TREES.
BUT
IN
THE
EVENING,
WHEN
THE
HEAT
COOLED
DOWN
AND
EVERYONE
IN
THE
CAMP
STARTED
TO
BUSTLE
ABOUT
AND
GATHERED
AROUND,
THEY
HEARD
THE
BUDDHA
TEACHING.
THEY
HEARD
HIS
VOICE,
AND
IT
WAS
ALSO
PERFECTED,
WAS
OF
PERFECT
CALMNESS,
WAS
FULL
OF
PEACE.
GOTAMA
TAUGHT
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
SUFFERING,
OF
THE
ORIGIN
OF
SUFFERING,
OF
THE
WAY
TO
RELIEVE
SUFFERING.
CALMLY
AND
CLEARLY
HIS
QUIET
SPEECH
FLOWED
ON.
SUFFERING
WAS
LIFE,
FULL
OF
SUFFERING
WAS
THE
WORLD,
BUT
SALVATION
FROM
SUFFERING
HAD
BEEN
FOUND:
SALVATION
WAS
OBTAINED
BY
HIM
WHO
WOULD
WALK
THE
PATH
OF
THE
BUDDHA.
WITH
A
SOFT,
YET
FIRM
VOICE
THE
EXALTED
ONE
SPOKE,
TAUGHT
THE
FOUR
MAIN
DOCTRINES,
TAUGHT
THE
EIGHTFOLD
PATH,
PATIENTLY
HE
WENT
THE
USUAL
PATH
OF
THE
TEACHINGS,
OF
THE
EXAMPLES,
OF
THE
REPETITIONS,
BRIGHTLY
AND
QUIETLY
HIS
VOICE
HOVERED
OVER
THE
LISTENERS,
LIKE
A
LIGHT,
LIKE
A
STARRY
SKY.
WHEN
THE
BUDDHA--NIGHT
HAD
ALREADY
FALLEN--ENDED
HIS
SPEECH,
MANY
A
PILGRIM
STEPPED
FORWARD
AND
ASKED
TO
ACCEPTED
INTO
THE
COMMUNITY,
SOUGHT
REFUGE
IN
THE
TEACHINGS.
AND
GOTAMA
ACCEPTED
THEM
BY
SPEAKING:
"YOU
HAVE
HEARD
THE
TEACHINGS
WELL,
IT
HAS
COME
TO
YOU
WELL.
THUS
JOIN
US
AND
WALK
IN
HOLINESS,
TO
PUT
AN
END
TO
ALL
SUFFERING."
BEHOLD,
THEN
GOVINDA,
THE
SHY
ONE,
ALSO
STEPPED
FORWARD
AND
SPOKE:
"I
ALSO
TAKE
MY
REFUGE
IN
THE
EXALTED
ONE
AND
HIS
TEACHINGS,"
AND
HE
ASKED
TO
ACCEPTED
INTO
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
WAS
ACCEPTED.
RIGHT
AFTERWARDS,
WHEN
THE
BUDDHA
HAD
RETIRED
FOR
THE
NIGHT,
GOVINDA
TURNED
TO
SIDDHARTHA
AND
SPOKE
EAGERLY:
"SIDDHARTHA,
IT
IS
NOT
MY
PLACE
TO
SCOLD
YOU.
WE
HAVE
BOTH
HEARD
THE
EXALTED
ONE,
WE
HAVE
BOTH
PERCEIVED
THE
TEACHINGS.
GOVINDA
HAS
HEARD
THE
TEACHINGS,
HE
HAS
TAKEN
REFUGE
IN
IT.
BUT
YOU,
MY
HONOURED
FRIEND,
DON'T
YOU
ALSO
WANT
TO
WALK
THE
PATH
OF
SALVATION?
WOULD
YOU
WANT
TO
HESITATE,
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
WAIT
ANY
LONGER?"
SIDDHARTHA
AWAKENED
AS
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
ASLEEP,
WHEN
HE
HEARD
GOVINDA'S
WORDS.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
LOOKED
INTO
GOVINDA'S
FACE.
THEN
HE
SPOKE
QUIETLY,
IN
A
VOICE
WITHOUT
MOCKERY:
"GOVINDA,
MY
FRIEND,
NOW
YOU
HAVE
TAKEN
THIS
STEP,
NOW
YOU
HAVE
CHOSEN
THIS
PATH.
ALWAYS,
OH
GOVINDA,
YOU'VE
BEEN
MY
FRIEND,
YOU'VE
ALWAYS
WALKED
ONE
STEP
BEHIND
ME.
OFTEN
I
HAVE
THOUGHT:
WON'T
GOVINDA
FOR
ONCE
ALSO
TAKE
A
STEP
BY
HIMSELF,
WITHOUT
ME,
OUT
OF
HIS
OWN
SOUL?
BEHOLD,
NOW
YOU'VE
TURNED
INTO
A
MAN
AND
ARE
CHOOSING
YOUR
PATH
FOR
YOURSELF.
I
WISH
THAT
YOU
WOULD
GO
IT
UP
TO
ITS
END,
OH
MY
FRIEND,
THAT
YOU
SHALL
FIND
SALVATION!"
GOVINDA,
NOT
COMPLETELY
UNDERSTANDING
IT
YET,
REPEATED
HIS
QUESTION
IN
AN
IMPATIENT
TONE:
"SPEAK
UP,
I
BEG
YOU,
MY
DEAR!
TELL
ME,
SINCE
IT
COULD
NOT
BE
ANY
OTHER
WAY,
THAT
YOU
ALSO,
MY
LEARNED
FRIEND,
WILL
TAKE
YOUR
REFUGE
WITH
THE
EXALTED
BUDDHA!"
SIDDHARTHA
PLACED
HIS
HAND
ON
GOVINDA'S
SHOULDER:
"YOU
FAILED
TO
HEAR
MY
GOOD
WISH
FOR
YOU,
OH
GOVINDA.
I'M
REPEATING
IT:
I
WISH
THAT
YOU
WOULD
GO
THIS
PATH
UP
TO
ITS
END,
THAT
YOU
SHALL
FIND
SALVATION!"
IN
THIS
MOMENT,
GOVINDA
REALIZED
THAT
HIS
FRIEND
HAD
LEFT
HIM,
AND
HE
STARTED
TO
WEEP.
"SIDDHARTHA!"
HE
EXCLAIMED
LAMENTINGLY.
SIDDHARTHA
KINDLY
SPOKE
TO
HIM:
"DON'T
FORGET,
GOVINDA,
THAT
YOU
ARE
NOW
ONE
OF
THE
SAMANAS
OF
THE
BUDDHA!
YOU
HAVE
RENOUNCED
YOUR
HOME
AND
YOUR
PARENTS,
RENOUNCED
YOUR
BIRTH
AND
POSSESSIONS,
RENOUNCED
YOUR
FREE
WILL,
RENOUNCED
ALL
FRIENDSHIP.
THIS
IS
WHAT
THE
TEACHINGS
REQUIRE,
THIS
IS
WHAT
THE
EXALTED
ONE
WANTS.
THIS
IS
WHAT
YOU
WANTED
FOR
YOURSELF.
TOMORROW,
OH
GOVINDA,
I'LL
LEAVE
YOU."
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
THE
FRIENDS
CONTINUED
WALKING
IN
THE
GROVE;
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
THEY
LAY
THERE
AND
FOUND
NO
SLEEP.
AND
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN,
GOVINDA
URGED
HIS
FRIEND,
HE
SHOULD
TELL
HIM
WHY
HE
WOULD
NOT
WANT
TO
SEEK
REFUGE
IN
GOTAMA'S
TEACHINGS,
WHAT
FAULT
HE
WOULD
FIND
IN
THESE
TEACHINGS.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
TURNED
HIM
AWAY
EVERY
TIME
AND
SAID:
"BE
CONTENT,
GOVINDA!
VERY
GOOD
ARE
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
THE
EXALTED
ONE,
HOW
COULD
I
FIND
A
FAULT
IN
THEM?"
VERY
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING,
A
FOLLOWER
OF
BUDDHA,
ONE
OF
HIS
OLDEST
MONKS,
WENT
THROUGH
THE
GARDEN
AND
CALLED
ALL
THOSE
TO
HIM
WHO
HAD
AS
NOVICES
TAKEN
THEIR
REFUGE
IN
THE
TEACHINGS,
TO
DRESS
THEM
UP
IN
THE
YELLOW
ROBE
AND
TO
INSTRUCT
THEM
IN
THE
FIRST
TEACHINGS
AND
DUTIES
OF
THEIR
POSITION.
THEN
GOVINDA
BROKE
LOOSE,
EMBRACED
ONCE
AGAIN
HIS
CHILDHOOD
FRIEND
AND
LEFT
WITH
THE
NOVICES.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
WALKED
THROUGH
THE
GROVE,
LOST
IN
THOUGHT.
THEN
HE
HAPPENED
TO
MEET
GOTAMA,
THE
EXALTED
ONE,
AND
WHEN
HE
GREETED
HIM
WITH
RESPECT
AND
THE
BUDDHA'S
GLANCE
WAS
SO
FULL
OF
KINDNESS
AND
CALM,
THE
YOUNG
MAN
SUMMONED
HIS
COURAGE
AND
ASKED
THE
VENERABLE
ONE
FOR
THE
PERMISSION
TO
TALK
TO
HIM.
SILENTLY
THE
EXALTED
ONE
NODDED
HIS
APPROVAL.
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"YESTERDAY,
OH
EXALTED
ONE,
I
HAD
BEEN
PRIVILEGED
TO
HEAR
YOUR
WONDROUS
TEACHINGS.
TOGETHER
WITH
MY
FRIEND,
I
HAD
COME
FROM
AFAR,
TO
HEAR
YOUR
TEACHINGS.
AND
NOW
MY
FRIEND
IS
GOING
TO
STAY
WITH
YOUR
PEOPLE,
HE
HAS
TAKEN
HIS
REFUGE
WITH
YOU.
BUT
I
WILL
AGAIN
START
ON
MY
PILGRIMAGE."
"AS
YOU
PLEASE,"
THE
VENERABLE
ONE
SPOKE
POLITELY.
"TOO
BOLD
IS
MY
SPEECH,"
SIDDHARTHA
CONTINUED,
"BUT
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
LEAVE
THE
EXALTED
ONE
WITHOUT
HAVING
HONESTLY
TOLD
HIM
MY
THOUGHTS.
DOES
IT
PLEASE
THE
VENERABLE
ONE
TO
LISTEN
TO
ME
FOR
ONE
MOMENT
LONGER?"
SILENTLY,
THE
BUDDHA
NODDED
HIS
APPROVAL.
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"ONE
THING,
OH
MOST
VENERABLE
ONE,
I
HAVE
ADMIRED
IN
YOUR
TEACHINGS
MOST
OF
ALL.
EVERYTHING
IN
YOUR
TEACHINGS
IS
PERFECTLY
CLEAR,
IS
PROVEN;
YOU
ARE
PRESENTING
THE
WORLD
AS
A
PERFECT
CHAIN,
A
CHAIN
WHICH
IS
NEVER
AND
NOWHERE
BROKEN,
AN
ETERNAL
CHAIN
THE
LINKS
OF
WHICH
ARE
CAUSES
AND
EFFECTS.
NEVER
BEFORE,
THIS
HAS
BEEN
SEEN
SO
CLEARLY;
NEVER
BEFORE,
THIS
HAS
BEEN
PRESENTED
SO
IRREFUTABLY;
TRULY,
THE
HEART
OF
EVERY
BRAHMAN
HAS
TO
BEAT
STRONGER
WITH
LOVE,
ONCE
HE
HAS
SEEN
THE
WORLD
THROUGH
YOUR
TEACHINGS
PERFECTLY
CONNECTED,
WITHOUT
GAPS,
CLEAR
AS
A
CRYSTAL,
NOT
DEPENDING
ON
CHANCE,
NOT
DEPENDING
ON
GODS.
WHETHER
IT
MAY
BE
GOOD
OR
BAD,
WHETHER
LIVING
ACCORDING
TO
IT
WOULD
BE
SUFFERING
OR
JOY,
I
DO
NOT
WISH
TO
DISCUSS,
POSSIBLY
THIS
IS
NOT
ESSENTIAL--BUT
THE
UNIFORMITY
OF
THE
WORLD,
THAT
EVERYTHING
WHICH
HAPPENS
IS
CONNECTED,
THAT
THE
GREAT
AND
THE
SMALL
THINGS
ARE
ALL
ENCOMPASSED
BY
THE
SAME
FORCES
OF
TIME,
BY
THE
SAME
LAW
OF
CAUSES,
OF
COMING
INTO
BEING
AND
OF
DYING,
THIS
IS
WHAT
SHINES
BRIGHTLY
OUT
OF
YOUR
EXALTED
TEACHINGS,
OH
PERFECTED
ONE.
BUT
ACCORDING
TO
YOUR
VERY
OWN
TEACHINGS,
THIS
UNITY
AND
NECESSARY
SEQUENCE
OF
ALL
THINGS
IS
NEVERTHELESS
BROKEN
IN
ONE
PLACE,
THROUGH
A
SMALL
GAP,
THIS
WORLD
OF
UNITY
IS
INVADED
BY
SOMETHING
ALIEN,
SOMETHING
NEW,
SOMETHING
WHICH
HAD
NOT
BEEN
THERE
BEFORE,
AND
WHICH
CANNOT
BE
DEMONSTRATED
AND
CANNOT
BE
PROVEN:
THESE
ARE
YOUR
TEACHINGS
OF
OVERCOMING
THE
WORLD,
OF
SALVATION.
BUT
WITH
THIS
SMALL
GAP,
WITH
THIS
SMALL
BREACH,
THE
ENTIRE
ETERNAL
AND
UNIFORM
LAW
OF
THE
WORLD
IS
BREAKING
APART
AGAIN
AND
BECOMES
VOID.
PLEASE
FORGIVE
ME
FOR
EXPRESSING
THIS
OBJECTION."
QUIETLY,
GOTAMA
HAD
LISTENED
TO
HIM,
UNMOVED.
NOW
HE
SPOKE,
THE
PERFECTED
ONE,
WITH
HIS
KIND,
WITH
HIS
POLITE
AND
CLEAR
VOICE:
"YOU'VE
HEARD
THE
TEACHINGS,
OH
SON
OF
A
BRAHMAN,
AND
GOOD
FOR
YOU
THAT
YOU'VE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
THUS
DEEPLY.
YOU'VE
FOUND
A
GAP
IN
IT,
AN
ERROR.
YOU
SHOULD
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
FURTHER.
BUT
BE
WARNED,
OH
SEEKER
OF
KNOWLEDGE,
OF
THE
THICKET
OF
OPINIONS
AND
OF
ARGUING
ABOUT
WORDS.
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
OPINIONS,
THEY
MAY
BE
BEAUTIFUL
OR
UGLY,
SMART
OR
FOOLISH,
EVERYONE
CAN
SUPPORT
THEM
OR
DISCARD
THEM.
BUT
THE
TEACHINGS,
YOU'VE
HEARD
FROM
ME,
ARE
NO
OPINION,
AND
THEIR
GOAL
IS
NOT
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
WORLD
TO
THOSE
WHO
SEEK
KNOWLEDGE.
THEY
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
GOAL;
THEIR
GOAL
IS
SALVATION
FROM
SUFFERING.
THIS
IS
WHAT
GOTAMA
TEACHES,
NOTHING
ELSE."
"I
WISH
THAT
YOU,
OH
EXALTED
ONE,
WOULD
NOT
BE
ANGRY
WITH
ME,"
SAID
THE
YOUNG
MAN.
"I
HAVE
NOT
SPOKEN
TO
YOU
LIKE
THIS
TO
ARGUE
WITH
YOU,
TO
ARGUE
ABOUT
WORDS.
YOU
ARE
TRULY
RIGHT,
THERE
IS
LITTLE
TO
OPINIONS.
BUT
LET
ME
SAY
THIS
ONE
MORE
THING:
I
HAVE
NOT
DOUBTED
IN
YOU
FOR
A
SINGLE
MOMENT.
I
HAVE
NOT
DOUBTED
FOR
A
SINGLE
MOMENT
THAT
YOU
ARE
BUDDHA,
THAT
YOU
HAVE
REACHED
THE
GOAL,
THE
HIGHEST
GOAL
TOWARDS
WHICH
SO
MANY
THOUSANDS
OF
BRAHMANS
AND
SONS
OF
BRAHMANS
ARE
ON
THEIR
WAY.
YOU
HAVE
FOUND
SALVATION
FROM
DEATH.
IT
HAS
COME
TO
YOU
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
YOUR
OWN
SEARCH,
ON
YOUR
OWN
PATH,
THROUGH
THOUGHTS,
THROUGH
MEDITATION,
THROUGH
REALIZATIONS,
THROUGH
ENLIGHTENMENT.
IT
HAS
NOT
COME
TO
YOU
BY
MEANS
OF
TEACHINGS!
AND--THUS
IS
MY
THOUGHT,
OH
EXALTED
ONE,--NOBODY
WILL
OBTAIN
SALVATION
BY
MEANS
OF
TEACHINGS!
YOU
WILL
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
CONVEY
AND
SAY
TO
ANYBODY,
OH
VENERABLE
ONE,
IN
WORDS
AND
THROUGH
TEACHINGS
WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED
TO
YOU
IN
THE
HOUR
OF
ENLIGHTENMENT!
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
THE
ENLIGHTENED
BUDDHA
CONTAIN
MUCH,
IT
TEACHES
MANY
TO
LIVE
RIGHTEOUSLY,
TO
AVOID
EVIL.
BUT
THERE
IS
ONE
THING
WHICH
THESE
SO
CLEAR,
THESE
SO
VENERABLE
TEACHINGS
DO
NOT
CONTAIN:
THEY
DO
NOT
CONTAIN
THE
MYSTERY
OF
WHAT
THE
EXALTED
ONE
HAS
EXPERIENCED
FOR
HIMSELF,
HE
ALONE
AMONG
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS.
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
HAVE
THOUGHT
AND
REALIZED,
WHEN
I
HAVE
HEARD
THE
TEACHINGS.
THIS
IS
WHY
I
AM
CONTINUING
MY
TRAVELS--NOT
TO
SEEK
OTHER,
BETTER
TEACHINGS,
FOR
I
KNOW
THERE
ARE
NONE,
BUT
TO
DEPART
FROM
ALL
TEACHINGS
AND
ALL
TEACHERS
AND
TO
REACH
MY
GOAL
BY
MYSELF
OR
TO
DIE.
BUT
OFTEN,
I'LL
THINK
OF
THIS
DAY,
OH
EXALTED
ONE,
AND
OF
THIS
HOUR,
WHEN
MY
EYES
BEHELD
A
HOLY
MAN."
THE
BUDDHA'S
EYES
QUIETLY
LOOKED
TO
THE
GROUND;
QUIETLY,
IN
PERFECT
EQUANIMITY
HIS
INSCRUTABLE
FACE
WAS
SMILING.
"I
WISH,"
THE
VENERABLE
ONE
SPOKE
SLOWLY,
"THAT
YOUR
THOUGHTS
SHALL
NOT
BE
IN
ERROR,
THAT
YOU
SHALL
REACH
THE
GOAL!
BUT
TELL
ME:
HAVE
YOU
SEEN
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
MY
SAMANAS,
MY
MANY
BROTHERS,
WHO
HAVE
TAKEN
REFUGE
IN
THE
TEACHINGS?
AND
DO
YOU
BELIEVE,
OH
STRANGER,
OH
SAMANA,
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
BETTER
FOR
THEM
ALL
THE
ABANDON
THE
TEACHINGS
AND
TO
RETURN
INTO
THE
LIFE
THE
WORLD
AND
OF
DESIRES?"
"FAR
IS
SUCH
A
THOUGHT
FROM
MY
MIND,"
EXCLAIMED
SIDDHARTHA.
"I
WISH
THAT
THEY
SHALL
ALL
STAY
WITH
THE
TEACHINGS,
THAT
THEY
SHALL
REACH
THEIR
GOAL!
IT
IS
NOT
MY
PLACE
TO
JUDGE
ANOTHER
PERSON'S
LIFE.
ONLY
FOR
MYSELF,
FOR
MYSELF
ALONE,
I
MUST
DECIDE,
I
MUST
CHOSE,
I
MUST
REFUSE.
SALVATION
FROM
THE
SELF
IS
WHAT
WE
SAMANAS
SEARCH
FOR,
OH
EXALTED
ONE.
IF
I
MERELY
WERE
ONE
OF
YOUR
DISCIPLES,
OH
VENERABLE
ONE,
I'D
FEAR
THAT
IT
MIGHT
HAPPEN
TO
ME
THAT
ONLY
SEEMINGLY,
ONLY
DECEPTIVELY
MY
SELF
WOULD
BE
CALM
AND
BE
REDEEMED,
BUT
THAT
IN
TRUTH
IT
WOULD
LIVE
ON
AND
GROW,
FOR
THEN
I
HAD
REPLACED
MY
SELF
WITH
THE
TEACHINGS,
MY
DUTY
TO
FOLLOW
YOU,
MY
LOVE
FOR
YOU,
AND
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
THE
MONKS!"
WITH
HALF
OF
A
SMILE,
WITH
AN
UNWAVERING
OPENNESS
AND
KINDNESS,
GOTAMA
LOOKED
INTO
THE
STRANGER'S
EYES
AND
BID
HIM
TO
LEAVE
WITH
A
HARDLY
NOTICEABLE
GESTURE.
"YOU
ARE
WISE,
OH
SAMANA.",
THE
VENERABLE
ONE
SPOKE.
"YOU
KNOW
HOW
TO
TALK
WISELY,
MY
FRIEND.
BE
AWARE
OF
TOO
MUCH
WISDOM!"
THE
BUDDHA
TURNED
AWAY,
AND
HIS
GLANCE
AND
HALF
OF
A
SMILE
REMAINED
FOREVER
ETCHED
IN
SIDDHARTHA'S
MEMORY.
I
HAVE
NEVER
BEFORE
SEEN
A
PERSON
GLANCE
AND
SMILE,
SIT
AND
WALK
THIS
WAY,
HE
THOUGHT;
TRULY,
I
WISH
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GLANCE
AND
SMILE,
SIT
AND
WALK
THIS
WAY,
TOO,
THUS
FREE,
THUS
VENERABLE,
THUS
CONCEALED,
THUS
OPEN,
THUS
CHILD-LIKE
AND
MYSTERIOUS.
TRULY,
ONLY
A
PERSON
WHO
HAS
SUCCEEDED
IN
REACHING
THE
INNERMOST
PART
OF
HIS
SELF
WOULD
GLANCE
AND
WALK
THIS
WAY.
WELL
SO,
I
ALSO
WILL
SEEK
TO
REACH
THE
INNERMOST
PART
OF
MY
SELF.
I
SAW
A
MAN,
SIDDHARTHA
THOUGHT,
A
SINGLE
MAN,
BEFORE
WHOM
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
LOWER
MY
GLANCE.
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
LOWER
MY
GLANCE
BEFORE
ANY
OTHER,
NOT
BEFORE
ANY
OTHER.
NO
TEACHINGS
WILL
ENTICE
ME
ANY
MORE,
SINCE
THIS
MAN'S
TEACHINGS
HAVE
NOT
ENTICED
ME.
I
AM
DEPRIVED
BY
THE
BUDDHA,
THOUGHT
SIDDHARTHA,
I
AM
DEPRIVED,
AND
EVEN
MORE
HE
HAS
GIVEN
TO
ME.
HE
HAS
DEPRIVED
ME
OF
MY
FRIEND,
THE
ONE
WHO
HAD
BELIEVED
IN
ME
AND
NOW
BELIEVES
IN
HIM,
WHO
HAD
BEEN
MY
SHADOW
AND
IS
NOW
GOTAMA'S
SHADOW.
BUT
HE
HAS
GIVEN
ME
SIDDHARTHA,
MYSELF.
AWAKENING
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
LEFT
THE
GROVE,
WHERE
THE
BUDDHA,
THE
PERFECTED
ONE,
STAYED
BEHIND,
WHERE
GOVINDA
STAYED
BEHIND,
THEN
HE
FELT
THAT
IN
THIS
GROVE
HIS
PAST
LIFE
ALSO
STAYED
BEHIND
AND
PARTED
FROM
HIM.
HE
PONDERED
ABOUT
THIS
SENSATION,
WHICH
FILLED
HIM
COMPLETELY,
AS
HE
WAS
SLOWLY
WALKING
ALONG.
HE
PONDERED
DEEPLY,
LIKE
DIVING
INTO
A
DEEP
WATER
HE
LET
HIMSELF
SINK
DOWN
TO
THE
GROUND
OF
THE
SENSATION,
DOWN
TO
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THE
CAUSES
LIE,
BECAUSE
TO
IDENTIFY
THE
CAUSES,
SO
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM,
IS
THE
VERY
ESSENCE
OF
THINKING,
AND
BY
THIS
ALONE
SENSATIONS
TURN
INTO
REALIZATIONS
AND
ARE
NOT
LOST,
BUT
BECOME
ENTITIES
AND
START
TO
EMIT
LIKE
RAYS
OF
LIGHT
WHAT
IS
INSIDE
OF
THEM.
SLOWLY
WALKING
ALONG,
SIDDHARTHA
PONDERED.
HE
REALIZED
THAT
HE
WAS
NO
YOUTH
ANY
MORE,
BUT
HAD
TURNED
INTO
A
MAN.
HE
REALIZED
THAT
ONE
THING
HAD
LEFT
HIM,
AS
A
SNAKE
IS
LEFT
BY
ITS
OLD
SKIN,
THAT
ONE
THING
NO
LONGER
EXISTED
IN
HIM,
WHICH
HAD
ACCOMPANIED
HIM
THROUGHOUT
HIS
YOUTH
AND
USED
TO
BE
A
PART
OF
HIM:
THE
WISH
TO
HAVE
TEACHERS
AND
TO
LISTEN
TO
TEACHINGS.
HE
HAD
ALSO
LEFT
THE
LAST
TEACHER
WHO
HAD
APPEARED
ON
HIS
PATH,
EVEN
HIM,
THE
HIGHEST
AND
WISEST
TEACHER,
THE
MOST
HOLY
ONE,
BUDDHA,
HE
HAD
LEFT
HIM,
HAD
TO
PART
WITH
HIM,
WAS
NOT
ABLE
TO
ACCEPT
HIS
TEACHINGS.
SLOWER,
HE
WALKED
ALONG
IN
HIS
THOUGHTS
AND
ASKED
HIMSELF:
"BUT
WHAT
IS
THIS,
WHAT
YOU
HAVE
SOUGHT
TO
LEARN
FROM
TEACHINGS
AND
FROM
TEACHERS,
AND
WHAT
THEY,
WHO
HAVE
TAUGHT
YOU
MUCH,
WERE
STILL
UNABLE
TO
TEACH
YOU?"
AND
HE
FOUND:
"IT
WAS
THE
SELF,
THE
PURPOSE
AND
ESSENCE
OF
WHICH
I
SOUGHT
TO
LEARN.
IT
WAS
THE
SELF,
I
WANTED
TO
FREE
MYSELF
FROM,
WHICH
I
SOUGHT
TO
OVERCOME.
BUT
I
WAS
NOT
ABLE
TO
OVERCOME
IT,
COULD
ONLY
DECEIVE
IT,
COULD
ONLY
FLEE
FROM
IT,
ONLY
HIDE
FROM
IT.
TRULY,
NO
THING
IN
THIS
WORLD
HAS
KEPT
MY
THOUGHTS
THUS
BUSY,
AS
THIS
MY
VERY
OWN
SELF,
THIS
MYSTERY
OF
ME
BEING
ALIVE,
OF
ME
BEING
ONE
AND
BEING
SEPARATED
AND
ISOLATED
FROM
ALL
OTHERS,
OF
ME
BEING
SIDDHARTHA!
AND
THERE
IS
NO
THING
IN
THIS
WORLD
I
KNOW
LESS
ABOUT
THAN
ABOUT
ME,
ABOUT
SIDDHARTHA!"
HAVING
BEEN
PONDERING
WHILE
SLOWLY
WALKING
ALONG,
HE
NOW
STOPPED
AS
THESE
THOUGHTS
CAUGHT
HOLD
OF
HIM,
AND
RIGHT
AWAY
ANOTHER
THOUGHT
SPRANG
FORTH
FROM
THESE,
A
NEW
THOUGHT,
WHICH
WAS:
"THAT
I
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
MYSELF,
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
HAS
REMAINED
THUS
ALIEN
AND
UNKNOWN
TO
ME,
STEMS
FROM
ONE
CAUSE,
A
SINGLE
CAUSE:
I
WAS
AFRAID
OF
MYSELF,
I
WAS
FLEEING
FROM
MYSELF!
I
SEARCHED
ATMAN,
I
SEARCHED
BRAHMAN,
I
WAS
WILLING
TO
DISSECT
MY
SELF
AND
PEEL
OFF
ALL
OF
ITS
LAYERS,
TO
FIND
THE
CORE
OF
ALL
PEELS
IN
ITS
UNKNOWN
INTERIOR,
THE
ATMAN,
LIFE,
THE
DIVINE
PART,
THE
ULTIMATE
PART.
BUT
I
HAVE
LOST
MYSELF
IN
THE
PROCESS."
SIDDHARTHA
OPENED
HIS
EYES
AND
LOOKED
AROUND,
A
SMILE
FILLED
HIS
FACE
AND
A
FEELING
OF
AWAKENING
FROM
LONG
DREAMS
FLOWED
THROUGH
HIM
FROM
HIS
HEAD
DOWN
TO
HIS
TOES.
AND
IT
WAS
NOT
LONG
BEFORE
HE
WALKED
AGAIN,
WALKED
QUICKLY
LIKE
A
MAN
WHO
KNOWS
WHAT
HE
HAS
GOT
TO
DO.
"OH,"
HE
THOUGHT,
TAKING
A
DEEP
BREATH,
"NOW
I
WOULD
NOT
LET
SIDDHARTHA
ESCAPE
FROM
ME
AGAIN!
NO
LONGER,
I
WANT
TO
BEGIN
MY
THOUGHTS
AND
MY
LIFE
WITH
ATMAN
AND
WITH
THE
SUFFERING
OF
THE
WORLD.
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
KILL
AND
DISSECT
MYSELF
ANY
LONGER,
TO
FIND
A
SECRET
BEHIND
THE
RUINS.
NEITHER
YOGA-VEDA
SHALL
TEACH
ME
ANY
MORE,
NOR
ATHARVA-VEDA,
NOR
THE
ASCETICS,
NOR
ANY
KIND
OF
TEACHINGS.
I
WANT
TO
LEARN
FROM
MYSELF,
WANT
TO
BE
MY
STUDENT,
WANT
TO
GET
TO
KNOW
MYSELF,
THE
SECRET
OF
SIDDHARTHA."
HE
LOOKED
AROUND,
AS
IF
HE
WAS
SEEING
THE
WORLD
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME.
BEAUTIFUL
WAS
THE
WORLD,
COLOURFUL
WAS
THE
WORLD,
STRANGE
AND
MYSTERIOUS
WAS
THE
WORLD!
HERE
WAS
BLUE,
HERE
WAS
YELLOW,
HERE
WAS
GREEN,
THE
SKY
AND
THE
RIVER
FLOWED,
THE
FOREST
AND
THE
MOUNTAINS
WERE
RIGID,
ALL
OF
IT
WAS
BEAUTIFUL,
ALL
OF
IT
WAS
MYSTERIOUS
AND
MAGICAL,
AND
IN
ITS
MIDST
WAS
HE,
SIDDHARTHA,
THE
AWAKENING
ONE,
ON
THE
PATH
TO
HIMSELF.
ALL
OF
THIS,
ALL
THIS
YELLOW
AND
BLUE,
RIVER
AND
FOREST,
ENTERED
SIDDHARTHA
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THROUGH
THE
EYES,
WAS
NO
LONGER
A
SPELL
OF
MARA,
WAS
NO
LONGER
THE
VEIL
OF
MAYA,
WAS
NO
LONGER
A
POINTLESS
AND
COINCIDENTAL
DIVERSITY
OF
MERE
APPEARANCES,
DESPICABLE
TO
THE
DEEPLY
THINKING
BRAHMAN,
WHO
SCORNS
DIVERSITY,
WHO
SEEKS
UNITY.
BLUE
WAS
BLUE,
RIVER
WAS
RIVER,
AND
IF
ALSO
IN
THE
BLUE
AND
THE
RIVER,
IN
SIDDHARTHA,
THE
SINGULAR
AND
DIVINE
LIVED
HIDDEN,
SO
IT
WAS
STILL
THAT
VERY
DIVINITY'S
WAY
AND
PURPOSE,
TO
BE
HERE
YELLOW,
HERE
BLUE,
THERE
SKY,
THERE
FOREST,
AND
HERE
SIDDHARTHA.
THE
PURPOSE
AND
THE
ESSENTIAL
PROPERTIES
WERE
NOT
SOMEWHERE
BEHIND
THE
THINGS,
THEY
WERE
IN
THEM,
IN
EVERYTHING.
"HOW
DEAF
AND
STUPID
HAVE
I
BEEN!"
HE
THOUGHT,
WALKING
SWIFTLY
ALONG.
"WHEN
SOMEONE
READS
A
TEXT,
WANTS
TO
DISCOVER
ITS
MEANING,
HE
WILL
NOT
SCORN
THE
SYMBOLS
AND
LETTERS
AND
CALL
THEM
DECEPTIONS,
COINCIDENCE,
AND
WORTHLESS
HULL,
BUT
HE
WILL
READ
THEM,
HE
WILL
STUDY
AND
LOVE
THEM,
LETTER
BY
LETTER.
BUT
I,
WHO
WANTED
TO
READ
THE
BOOK
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
THE
BOOK
OF
MY
OWN
BEING,
I
HAVE,
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
A
MEANING
I
HAD
ANTICIPATED
BEFORE
I
READ,
SCORNED
THE
SYMBOLS
AND
LETTERS,
I
CALLED
THE
VISIBLE
WORLD
A
DECEPTION,
CALLED
MY
EYES
AND
MY
TONGUE
COINCIDENTAL
AND
WORTHLESS
FORMS
WITHOUT
SUBSTANCE.
NO,
THIS
IS
OVER,
I
HAVE
AWAKENED,
I
HAVE
INDEED
AWAKENED
AND
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
BORN
BEFORE
THIS
VERY
DAY."
IN
THINKING
THIS
THOUGHTS,
SIDDHARTHA
STOPPED
ONCE
AGAIN,
SUDDENLY,
AS
IF
THERE
WAS
A
SNAKE
LYING
IN
FRONT
OF
HIM
ON
THE
PATH.
BECAUSE
SUDDENLY,
HE
HAD
ALSO
BECOME
AWARE
OF
THIS:
HE,
WHO
WAS
INDEED
LIKE
SOMEONE
WHO
HAD
JUST
WOKEN
UP
OR
LIKE
A
NEW-BORN
BABY,
HE
HAD
TO
START
HIS
LIFE
ANEW
AND
START
AGAIN
AT
THE
VERY
BEGINNING.
WHEN
HE
HAD
LEFT
IN
THIS
VERY
MORNING
FROM
THE
GROVE
JETAVANA,
THE
GROVE
OF
THAT
EXALTED
ONE,
ALREADY
AWAKENING,
ALREADY
ON
THE
PATH
TOWARDS
HIMSELF,
HE
HAD
EVERY
INTENTION,
REGARDED
AS
NATURAL
AND
TOOK
FOR
GRANTED,
THAT
HE,
AFTER
YEARS
AS
AN
ASCETIC,
WOULD
RETURN
TO
HIS
HOME
AND
HIS
FATHER.
BUT
NOW,
ONLY
IN
THIS
MOMENT,
WHEN
HE
STOPPED
AS
IF
A
SNAKE
WAS
LYING
ON
HIS
PATH,
HE
ALSO
AWOKE
TO
THIS
REALIZATION:
"BUT
I
AM
NO
LONGER
THE
ONE
I
WAS,
I
AM
NO
ASCETIC
ANY
MORE,
I
AM
NOT
A
PRIEST
ANY
MORE,
I
AM
NO
BRAHMAN
ANY
MORE.
WHATEVER
SHOULD
I
DO
AT
HOME
AND
AT
MY
FATHER'S
PLACE?
STUDY?
MAKE
OFFERINGS?
PRACTISE
MEDITATION?
BUT
ALL
THIS
IS
OVER,
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
NO
LONGER
ALONGSIDE
MY
PATH."
MOTIONLESS,
SIDDHARTHA
REMAINED
STANDING
THERE,
AND
FOR
THE
TIME
OF
ONE
MOMENT
AND
BREATH,
HIS
HEART
FELT
COLD,
HE
FELT
A
COLD
IN
HIS
CHEST,
AS
A
SMALL
ANIMAL,
A
BIRD
OR
A
RABBIT,
WOULD
WHEN
SEEING
HOW
ALONE
HE
WAS.
FOR
MANY
YEARS,
HE
HAD
BEEN
WITHOUT
HOME
AND
HAD
FELT
NOTHING.
NOW,
HE
FELT
IT.
STILL,
EVEN
IN
THE
DEEPEST
MEDITATION,
HE
HAD
BEEN
HIS
FATHER'S
SON,
HAD
BEEN
A
BRAHMAN,
OF
A
HIGH
CASTE,
A
CLERIC.
NOW,
HE
WAS
NOTHING
BUT
SIDDHARTHA,
THE
AWOKEN
ONE,
NOTHING
ELSE
WAS
LEFT.
DEEPLY,
HE
INHALED,
AND
FOR
A
MOMENT,
HE
FELT
COLD
AND
SHIVERED.
NOBODY
WAS
THUS
ALONE
AS
HE
WAS.
THERE
WAS
NO
NOBLEMAN
WHO
DID
NOT
BELONG
TO
THE
NOBLEMEN,
NO
WORKER
THAT
DID
NOT
BELONG
TO
THE
WORKERS,
AND
FOUND
REFUGE
WITH
THEM,
SHARED
THEIR
LIFE,
SPOKE
THEIR
LANGUAGE.
NO
BRAHMAN,
WHO
WOULD
NOT
BE
REGARDED
AS
BRAHMANS
AND
LIVED
WITH
THEM,
NO
ASCETIC
WHO
WOULD
NOT
FIND
HIS
REFUGE
IN
THE
CASTE
OF
THE
SAMANAS,
AND
EVEN
THE
MOST
FORLORN
HERMIT
IN
THE
FOREST
WAS
NOT
JUST
ONE
AND
ALONE,
HE
WAS
ALSO
SURROUNDED
BY
A
PLACE
HE
BELONGED
TO,
HE
ALSO
BELONGED
TO
A
CASTE,
IN
WHICH
HE
WAS
AT
HOME.
GOVINDA
HAD
BECOME
A
MONK,
AND
A
THOUSAND
MONKS
WERE
HIS
BROTHERS,
WORE
THE
SAME
ROBE
AS
HE,
BELIEVED
IN
HIS
FAITH,
SPOKE
HIS
LANGUAGE.
BUT
HE,
SIDDHARTHA,
WHERE
DID
HE
BELONG
TO?
WITH
WHOM
WOULD
HE
SHARE
HIS
LIFE?
WHOSE
LANGUAGE
WOULD
HE
SPEAK?
OUT
OF
THIS
MOMENT,
WHEN
THE
WORLD
MELTED
AWAY
ALL
AROUND
HIM,
WHEN
HE
STOOD
ALONE
LIKE
A
STAR
IN
THE
SKY,
OUT
OF
THIS
MOMENT
OF
A
COLD
AND
DESPAIR,
SIDDHARTHA
EMERGED,
MORE
A
SELF
THAN
BEFORE,
MORE
FIRMLY
CONCENTRATED.
HE
FELT:
THIS
HAD
BEEN
THE
LAST
TREMOR
OF
THE
AWAKENING,
THE
LAST
STRUGGLE
OF
THIS
BIRTH.
AND
IT
WAS
NOT
LONG
UNTIL
HE
WALKED
AGAIN
IN
LONG
STRIDES,
STARTED
TO
PROCEED
SWIFTLY
AND
IMPATIENTLY,
HEADING
NO
LONGER
FOR
HOME,
NO
LONGER
TO
HIS
FATHER,
NO
LONGER
BACK.
SECOND
PART
DEDICATED
TO
WILHELM
GUNDERT,
MY
COUSIN
IN
JAPAN
KAMALA
SIDDHARTHA
LEARNED
SOMETHING
NEW
ON
EVERY
STEP
OF
HIS
PATH,
FOR
THE
WORLD
WAS
TRANSFORMED,
AND
HIS
HEART
WAS
ENCHANTED.
HE
SAW
THE
SUN
RISING
OVER
THE
MOUNTAINS
WITH
THEIR
FORESTS
AND
SETTING
OVER
THE
DISTANT
BEACH
WITH
ITS
PALM-TREES.
AT
NIGHT,
HE
SAW
THE
STARS
IN
THE
SKY
IN
THEIR
FIXED
POSITIONS
AND
THE
CRESCENT
OF
THE
MOON
FLOATING
LIKE
A
BOAT
IN
THE
BLUE.
HE
SAW
TREES,
STARS,
ANIMALS,
CLOUDS,
RAINBOWS,
ROCKS,
HERBS,
FLOWERS,
STREAM
AND
RIVER,
THE
GLISTENING
DEW
IN
THE
BUSHES
IN
THE
MORNING,
DISTANT
HIGH
MOUNTAINS
WHICH
WERE
BLUE
AND
PALE,
BIRDS
SANG
AND
BEES,
WIND
SILVERISHLY
BLEW
THROUGH
THE
RICE-FIELD.
ALL
OF
THIS,
A
THOUSAND-FOLD
AND
COLOURFUL,
HAD
ALWAYS
BEEN
THERE,
ALWAYS
THE
SUN
AND
THE
MOON
HAD
SHONE,
ALWAYS
RIVERS
HAD
ROARED
AND
BEES
HAD
BUZZED,
BUT
IN
FORMER
TIMES
ALL
OF
THIS
HAD
BEEN
NOTHING
MORE
TO
SIDDHARTHA
THAN
A
FLEETING,
DECEPTIVE
VEIL
BEFORE
HIS
EYES,
LOOKED
UPON
IN
DISTRUST,
DESTINED
TO
BE
PENETRATED
AND
DESTROYED
BY
THOUGHT,
SINCE
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
ESSENTIAL
EXISTENCE,
SINCE
THIS
ESSENCE
LAY
BEYOND,
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF,
THE
VISIBLE.
BUT
NOW,
HIS
LIBERATED
EYES
STAYED
ON
THIS
SIDE,
HE
SAW
AND
BECAME
AWARE
OF
THE
VISIBLE,
SOUGHT
TO
BE
AT
HOME
IN
THIS
WORLD,
DID
NOT
SEARCH
FOR
THE
TRUE
ESSENCE,
DID
NOT
AIM
AT
A
WORLD
BEYOND.
BEAUTIFUL
WAS
THIS
WORLD,
LOOKING
AT
IT
THUS,
WITHOUT
SEARCHING,
THUS
SIMPLY,
THUS
CHILDLIKE.
BEAUTIFUL
WERE
THE
MOON
AND
THE
STARS,
BEAUTIFUL
WAS
THE
STREAM
AND
THE
BANKS,
THE
FOREST
AND
THE
ROCKS,
THE
GOAT
AND
THE
GOLD-BEETLE,
THE
FLOWER
AND
THE
BUTTERFLY.
BEAUTIFUL
AND
LOVELY
IT
WAS,
THUS
TO
WALK
THROUGH
THE
WORLD,
THUS
CHILDLIKE,
THUS
AWOKEN,
THUS
OPEN
TO
WHAT
IS
NEAR,
THUS
WITHOUT
DISTRUST.
DIFFERENTLY
THE
SUN
BURNT
THE
HEAD,
DIFFERENTLY
THE
SHADE
OF
THE
FOREST
COOLED
HIM
DOWN,
DIFFERENTLY
THE
STREAM
AND
THE
CISTERN,
THE
PUMPKIN
AND
THE
BANANA
TASTED.
SHORT
WERE
THE
DAYS,
SHORT
THE
NIGHTS,
EVERY
HOUR
SPED
SWIFTLY
AWAY
LIKE
A
SAIL
ON
THE
SEA,
AND
UNDER
THE
SAIL
WAS
A
SHIP
FULL
OF
TREASURES,
FULL
OF
JOY.
SIDDHARTHA
SAW
A
GROUP
OF
APES
MOVING
THROUGH
THE
HIGH
CANOPY
OF
THE
FOREST,
HIGH
IN
THE
BRANCHES,
AND
HEARD
THEIR
SAVAGE,
GREEDY
SONG.
SIDDHARTHA
SAW
A
MALE
SHEEP
FOLLOWING
A
FEMALE
ONE
AND
MATING
WITH
HER.
IN
A
LAKE
OF
REEDS,
HE
SAW
THE
PIKE
HUNGRILY
HUNTING
FOR
ITS
DINNER;
PROPELLING
THEMSELVES
AWAY
FROM
IT,
IN
FEAR,
WIGGLING
AND
SPARKLING,
THE
YOUNG
FISH
JUMPED
IN
DROVES
OUT
OF
THE
WATER;
THE
SCENT
OF
STRENGTH
AND
PASSION
CAME
FORCEFULLY
OUT
OF
THE
HASTY
EDDIES
OF
THE
WATER,
WHICH
THE
PIKE
STIRRED
UP,
IMPETUOUSLY
HUNTING.
ALL
OF
THIS
HAD
ALWAYS
EXISTED,
AND
HE
HAD
NOT
SEEN
IT;
HE
HAD
NOT
BEEN
WITH
IT.
NOW
HE
WAS
WITH
IT,
HE
WAS
PART
OF
IT.
LIGHT
AND
SHADOW
RAN
THROUGH
HIS
EYES,
STARS
AND
MOON
RAN
THROUGH
HIS
HEART.
ON
THE
WAY,
SIDDHARTHA
ALSO
REMEMBERED
EVERYTHING
HE
HAD
EXPERIENCED
IN
THE
GARDEN
JETAVANA,
THE
TEACHING
HE
HAD
HEARD
THERE,
THE
DIVINE
BUDDHA,
THE
FAREWELL
FROM
GOVINDA,
THE
CONVERSATION
WITH
THE
EXALTED
ONE.
AGAIN
HE
REMEMBERED
HIS
OWN
WORDS,
HE
HAD
SPOKEN
TO
THE
EXALTED
ONE,
EVERY
WORD,
AND
WITH
ASTONISHMENT
HE
BECAME
AWARE
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
HE
HAD
SAID
THINGS
WHICH
HE
HAD
NOT
REALLY
KNOWN
YET
AT
THIS
TIME.
WHAT
HE
HAD
SAID
TO
GOTAMA:
HIS,
THE
BUDDHA'S,
TREASURE
AND
SECRET
WAS
NOT
THE
TEACHINGS,
BUT
THE
UNEXPRESSABLE
AND
NOT
TEACHABLE,
WHICH
HE
HAD
EXPERIENCED
IN
THE
HOUR
OF
HIS
ENLIGHTENMENT--IT
WAS
NOTHING
BUT
THIS
VERY
THING
WHICH
HE
HAD
NOW
GONE
TO
EXPERIENCE,
WHAT
HE
NOW
BEGAN
TO
EXPERIENCE.
NOW,
HE
HAD
TO
EXPERIENCE
HIS
SELF.
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
HE
HAD
ALREADY
KNOWN
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
THAT
HIS
SELF
WAS
ATMAN,
IN
ITS
ESSENCE
BEARING
THE
SAME
ETERNAL
CHARACTERISTICS
AS
BRAHMAN.
BUT
NEVER,
HE
HAD
REALLY
FOUND
THIS
SELF,
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
WANTED
TO
CAPTURE
IT
IN
THE
NET
OF
THOUGHT.
WITH
THE
BODY
DEFINITELY
NOT
BEING
THE
SELF,
AND
NOT
THE
SPECTACLE
OF
THE
SENSES,
SO
IT
ALSO
WAS
NOT
THE
THOUGHT,
NOT
THE
RATIONAL
MIND,
NOT
THE
LEARNED
WISDOM,
NOT
THE
LEARNED
ABILITY
TO
DRAW
CONCLUSIONS
AND
TO
DEVELOP
PREVIOUS
THOUGHTS
IN
TO
NEW
ONES.
NO,
THIS
WORLD
OF
THOUGHT
WAS
ALSO
STILL
ON
THIS
SIDE,
AND
NOTHING
COULD
BE
ACHIEVED
BY
KILLING
THE
RANDOM
SELF
OF
THE
SENSES,
IF
THE
RANDOM
SELF
OF
THOUGHTS
AND
LEARNED
KNOWLEDGE
WAS
FATTENED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND.
BOTH,
THE
THOUGHTS
AS
WELL
AS
THE
SENSES,
WERE
PRETTY
THINGS,
THE
ULTIMATE
MEANING
WAS
HIDDEN
BEHIND
BOTH
OF
THEM,
BOTH
HAD
TO
BE
LISTENED
TO,
BOTH
HAD
TO
BE
PLAYED
WITH,
BOTH
NEITHER
HAD
TO
BE
SCORNED
NOR
OVERESTIMATED,
FROM
BOTH
THE
SECRET
VOICES
OF
THE
INNERMOST
TRUTH
HAD
TO
BE
ATTENTIVELY
PERCEIVED.
HE
WANTED
TO
STRIVE
FOR
NOTHING,
EXCEPT
FOR
WHAT
THE
VOICE
COMMANDED
HIM
TO
STRIVE
FOR,
DWELL
ON
NOTHING,
EXCEPT
WHERE
THE
VOICE
WOULD
ADVISE
HIM
TO
DO
SO.
WHY
HAD
GOTAMA,
AT
THAT
TIME,
IN
THE
HOUR
OF
ALL
HOURS,
SAT
DOWN
UNDER
THE
BO-TREE,
WHERE
THE
ENLIGHTENMENT
HIT
HIM?
HE
HAD
HEARD
A
VOICE,
A
VOICE
IN
HIS
OWN
HEART,
WHICH
HAD
COMMANDED
HIM
TO
SEEK
REST
UNDER
THIS
TREE,
AND
HE
HAD
NEITHER
PREFERRED
SELF-CASTIGATION,
OFFERINGS,
ABLUTIONS,
NOR
PRAYER,
NEITHER
FOOD
NOR
DRINK,
NEITHER
SLEEP
NOR
DREAM,
HE
HAD
OBEYED
THE
VOICE.
TO
OBEY
LIKE
THIS,
NOT
TO
AN
EXTERNAL
COMMAND,
ONLY
TO
THE
VOICE,
TO
BE
READY
LIKE
THIS,
THIS
WAS
GOOD,
THIS
WAS
NECESSARY,
NOTHING
ELSE
WAS
NECESSARY.
IN
THE
NIGHT
WHEN
HE
SLEPT
IN
THE
STRAW
HUT
OF
A
FERRYMAN
BY
THE
RIVER,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
A
DREAM:
GOVINDA
WAS
STANDING
IN
FRONT
OF
HIM,
DRESSED
IN
THE
YELLOW
ROBE
OF
AN
ASCETIC.
SAD
WAS
HOW
GOVINDA
LOOKED
LIKE,
SADLY
HE
ASKED:
WHY
HAVE
YOU
FORSAKEN
ME?
AT
THIS,
HE
EMBRACED
GOVINDA,
WRAPPED
HIS
ARMS
AROUND
HIM,
AND
AS
HE
WAS
PULLING
HIM
CLOSE
TO
HIS
CHEST
AND
KISSED
HIM,
IT
WAS
NOT
GOVINDA
ANY
MORE,
BUT
A
WOMAN,
AND
A
FULL
BREAST
POPPED
OUT
OF
THE
WOMAN'S
DRESS,
AT
WHICH
SIDDHARTHA
LAY
AND
DRANK,
SWEETLY
AND
STRONGLY
TASTED
THE
MILK
FROM
THIS
BREAST.
IT
TASTED
OF
WOMAN
AND
MAN,
OF
SUN
AND
FOREST,
OF
ANIMAL
AND
FLOWER,
OF
EVERY
FRUIT,
OF
EVERY
JOYFUL
DESIRE.
IT
INTOXICATED
HIM
AND
RENDERED
HIM
UNCONSCIOUS.--WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
WOKE
UP,
THE
PALE
RIVER
SHIMMERED
THROUGH
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
HUT,
AND
IN
THE
FOREST,
A
DARK
CALL
OF
AN
OWL
RESOUNDED
DEEPLY
AND
PLEASANTLY.
WHEN
THE
DAY
BEGAN,
SIDDHARTHA
ASKED
HIS
HOST,
THE
FERRYMAN,
TO
GET
HIM
ACROSS
THE
RIVER.
THE
FERRYMAN
GOT
HIM
ACROSS
THE
RIVER
ON
HIS
BAMBOO-RAFT,
THE
WIDE
WATER
SHIMMERED
REDDISHLY
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
MORNING.
"THIS
IS
A
BEAUTIFUL
RIVER,"
HE
SAID
TO
HIS
COMPANION.
"YES,"
SAID
THE
FERRYMAN,
"A
VERY
BEAUTIFUL
RIVER,
I
LOVE
IT
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING.
OFTEN
I
HAVE
LISTENED
TO
IT,
OFTEN
I
HAVE
LOOKED
INTO
ITS
EYES,
AND
ALWAYS
I
HAVE
LEARNED
FROM
IT.
MUCH
CAN
BE
LEARNED
FROM
A
RIVER."
"I
THAN
YOU,
MY
BENEFACTOR,"
SPOKE
SIDDHARTHA,
DISEMBARKING
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
RIVER.
"I
HAVE
NO
GIFT
I
COULD
GIVE
YOU
FOR
YOUR
HOSPITALITY,
MY
DEAR,
AND
ALSO
NO
PAYMENT
FOR
YOUR
WORK.
I
AM
A
MAN
WITHOUT
A
HOME,
A
SON
OF
A
BRAHMAN
AND
A
SAMANA."
"I
DID
SEE
IT,"
SPOKE
THE
FERRYMAN,
"AND
I
HAVEN'T
EXPECTED
ANY
PAYMENT
FROM
YOU
AND
NO
GIFT
WHICH
WOULD
BE
THE
CUSTOM
FOR
GUESTS
TO
BEAR.
YOU
WILL
GIVE
ME
THE
GIFT
ANOTHER
TIME."
"DO
YOU
THINK
SO?"
ASKED
SIDDHARTHA
AMUSEDLY.
"SURELY.
THIS
TOO,
I
HAVE
LEARNED
FROM
THE
RIVER:
EVERYTHING
IS
COMING
BACK!
YOU
TOO,
SAMANA,
WILL
COME
BACK.
NOW
FAREWELL!
LET
YOUR
FRIENDSHIP
BE
MY
REWARD.
COMMEMORATE
ME,
WHEN
YOU'LL
MAKE
OFFERINGS
TO
THE
GODS."
SMILING,
THEY
PARTED.
SMILING,
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
HAPPY
ABOUT
THE
FRIENDSHIP
AND
THE
KINDNESS
OF
THE
FERRYMAN.
"HE
IS
LIKE
GOVINDA,"
HE
THOUGHT
WITH
A
SMILE,
"ALL
I
MEET
ON
MY
PATH
ARE
LIKE
GOVINDA.
ALL
ARE
THANKFUL,
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
THE
ONES
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
RECEIVE
THANKS.
ALL
ARE
SUBMISSIVE,
ALL
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BE
FRIENDS,
LIKE
TO
OBEY,
THINK
LITTLE.
LIKE
CHILDREN
ARE
ALL
PEOPLE."
AT
ABOUT
NOON,
HE
CAME
THROUGH
A
VILLAGE.
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
MUD
COTTAGES,
CHILDREN
WERE
ROLLING
ABOUT
IN
THE
STREET,
WERE
PLAYING
WITH
PUMPKIN-SEEDS
AND
SEA-SHELLS,
SCREAMED
AND
WRESTLED,
BUT
THEY
ALL
TIMIDLY
FLED
FROM
THE
UNKNOWN
SAMANA.
IN
THE
END
OF
THE
VILLAGE,
THE
PATH
LED
THROUGH
A
STREAM,
AND
BY
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
STREAM,
A
YOUNG
WOMAN
WAS
KNEELING
AND
WASHING
CLOTHES.
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
GREETED
HER,
SHE
LIFTED
HER
HEAD
AND
LOOKED
UP
TO
HIM
WITH
A
SMILE,
SO
THAT
HE
SAW
THE
WHITE
IN
HER
EYES
GLISTENING.
HE
CALLED
OUT
A
BLESSING
TO
HER,
AS
IT
IS
THE
CUSTOM
AMONG
TRAVELLERS,
AND
ASKED
HOW
FAR
HE
STILL
HAD
TO
GO
TO
REACH
THE
LARGE
CITY.
THEN
SHE
GOT
UP
AND
CAME
TO
HIM,
BEAUTIFULLY
HER
WET
MOUTH
WAS
SHIMMERING
IN
HER
YOUNG
FACE.
SHE
EXCHANGED
HUMOROUS
BANTER
WITH
HIM,
ASKED
WHETHER
HE
HAD
EATEN
ALREADY,
AND
WHETHER
IT
WAS
TRUE
THAT
THE
SAMANAS
SLEPT
ALONE
IN
THE
FOREST
AT
NIGHT
AND
WERE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
ANY
WOMEN
WITH
THEM.
WHILE
TALKING,
SHE
PUT
HER
LEFT
FOOT
ON
HIS
RIGHT
ONE
AND
MADE
A
MOVEMENT
AS
A
WOMAN
DOES
WHO
WOULD
WANT
TO
INITIATE
THAT
KIND
OF
SEXUAL
PLEASURE
WITH
A
MAN,
WHICH
THE
TEXTBOOKS
CALL
"CLIMBING
A
TREE".
SIDDHARTHA
FELT
HIS
BLOOD
HEATING
UP,
AND
SINCE
IN
THIS
MOMENT
HE
HAD
TO
THINK
OF
HIS
DREAM
AGAIN,
HE
BEND
SLIGHTLY
DOWN
TO
THE
WOMAN
AND
KISSED
WITH
HIS
LIPS
THE
BROWN
NIPPLE
OF
HER
BREAST.
LOOKING
UP,
HE
SAW
HER
FACE
SMILING
FULL
OF
LUST
AND
HER
EYES,
WITH
CONTRACTED
PUPILS,
BEGGING
WITH
DESIRE.
SIDDHARTHA
ALSO
FELT
DESIRE
AND
FELT
THE
SOURCE
OF
HIS
SEXUALITY
MOVING;
BUT
SINCE
HE
HAD
NEVER
TOUCHED
A
WOMAN
BEFORE,
HE
HESITATED
FOR
A
MOMENT,
WHILE
HIS
HANDS
WERE
ALREADY
PREPARED
TO
REACH
OUT
FOR
HER.
AND
IN
THIS
MOMENT
HE
HEARD,
SHUDDERING
WITH
AWE,
THE
VOICE
IF
HIS
INNERMOST
SELF,
AND
THIS
VOICE
SAID
NO.
THEN,
ALL
CHARMS
DISAPPEARED
FROM
THE
YOUNG
WOMAN'S
SMILING
FACE,
HE
NO
LONGER
SAW
ANYTHING
ELSE
BUT
THE
DAMP
GLANCE
OF
A
FEMALE
ANIMAL
IN
HEAT.
POLITELY,
HE
PETTED
HER
CHEEK,
TURNED
AWAY
FROM
HER
AND
DISAPPEARED
AWAY
FROM
THE
DISAPPOINTED
WOMAN
WITH
LIGHT
STEPS
INTO
THE
BAMBOO-WOOD.
ON
THIS
DAY,
HE
REACHED
THE
LARGE
CITY
BEFORE
THE
EVENING,
AND
WAS
HAPPY,
FOR
HE
FELT
THE
NEED
TO
BE
AMONG
PEOPLE.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
HAD
LIVED
IN
THE
FORESTS,
AND
THE
STRAW
HUT
OF
THE
FERRYMAN,
IN
WHICH
HE
HAD
SLEPT
THAT
NIGHT,
HAD
BEEN
THE
FIRST
ROOF
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
HE
HAS
HAD
OVER
HIS
HEAD.
BEFORE
THE
CITY,
IN
A
BEAUTIFULLY
FENCED
GROVE,
THE
TRAVELLER
CAME
ACROSS
A
SMALL
GROUP
OF
SERVANTS,
BOTH
MALE
AND
FEMALE,
CARRYING
BASKETS.
IN
THEIR
MIDST,
CARRIED
BY
FOUR
SERVANTS
IN
AN
ORNAMENTAL
SEDAN-CHAIR,
SAT
A
WOMAN,
THE
MISTRESS,
ON
RED
PILLOWS
UNDER
A
COLOURFUL
CANOPY.
SIDDHARTHA
STOPPED
AT
THE
ENTRANCE
TO
THE
PLEASURE-GARDEN
AND
WATCHED
THE
PARADE,
SAW
THE
SERVANTS,
THE
MAIDS,
THE
BASKETS,
SAW
THE
SEDAN-CHAIR
AND
SAW
THE
LADY
IN
IT.
UNDER
BLACK
HAIR,
WHICH
MADE
TO
TOWER
HIGH
ON
HER
HEAD,
HE
SAW
A
VERY
FAIR,
VERY
DELICATE,
VERY
SMART
FACE,
A
BRIGHTLY
RED
MOUTH,
LIKE
A
FRESHLY
CRACKED
FIG,
EYEBROWS
WHICH
WERE
WELL
TENDED
AND
PAINTED
IN
A
HIGH
ARCH,
SMART
AND
WATCHFUL
DARK
EYES,
A
CLEAR,
TALL
NECK
RISING
FROM
A
GREEN
AND
GOLDEN
GARMENT,
RESTING
FAIR
HANDS,
LONG
AND
THIN,
WITH
WIDE
GOLDEN
BRACELETS
OVER
THE
WRISTS.
SIDDHARTHA
SAW
HOW
BEAUTIFUL
SHE
WAS,
AND
HIS
HEART
REJOICED.
HE
BOWED
DEEPLY,
WHEN
THE
SEDAN-CHAIR
CAME
CLOSER,
AND
STRAIGHTENING
UP
AGAIN,
HE
LOOKED
AT
THE
FAIR,
CHARMING
FACE,
READ
FOR
A
MOMENT
IN
THE
SMART
EYES
WITH
THE
HIGH
ARCS
ABOVE,
BREATHED
IN
A
SLIGHT
FRAGRANT,
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW.
WITH
A
SMILE,
THE
BEAUTIFUL
WOMEN
NODDED
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
DISAPPEARED
INTO
THE
GROVE,
AND
THEN
THE
SERVANT
AS
WELL.
THUS
I
AM
ENTERING
THIS
CITY,
SIDDHARTHA
THOUGHT,
WITH
A
CHARMING
OMEN.
HE
INSTANTLY
FELT
DRAWN
INTO
THE
GROVE,
BUT
HE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IT,
AND
ONLY
NOW
HE
BECAME
AWARE
OF
HOW
THE
SERVANTS
AND
MAIDS
HAD
LOOKED
AT
HIM
AT
THE
ENTRANCE,
HOW
DESPICABLE,
HOW
DISTRUSTFUL,
HOW
REJECTING.
I
AM
STILL
A
SAMANA,
HE
THOUGHT,
I
AM
STILL
AN
ASCETIC
AND
BEGGAR.
I
MUST
NOT
REMAIN
LIKE
THIS,
I
WILL
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
ENTER
THE
GROVE
LIKE
THIS.
AND
HE
LAUGHED.
THE
NEXT
PERSON
WHO
CAME
ALONG
THIS
PATH
HE
ASKED
ABOUT
THE
GROVE
AND
FOR
THE
NAME
OF
THE
WOMAN,
AND
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THIS
WAS
THE
GROVE
OF
KAMALA,
THE
FAMOUS
COURTESAN,
AND
THAT,
ASIDE
FROM
THE
GROVE,
SHE
OWNED
A
HOUSE
IN
THE
CITY.
THEN,
HE
ENTERED
THE
CITY.
NOW
HE
HAD
A
GOAL.
PURSUING
HIS
GOAL,
HE
ALLOWED
THE
CITY
TO
SUCK
HIM
IN,
DRIFTED
THROUGH
THE
FLOW
OF
THE
STREETS,
STOOD
STILL
ON
THE
SQUARES,
RESTED
ON
THE
STAIRS
OF
STONE
BY
THE
RIVER.
WHEN
THE
EVENING
CAME,
HE
MADE
FRIENDS
WITH
BARBER'S
ASSISTANT,
WHOM
HE
HAD
SEEN
WORKING
IN
THE
SHADE
OF
AN
ARCH
IN
A
BUILDING,
WHOM
HE
FOUND
AGAIN
PRAYING
IN
A
TEMPLE
OF
VISHNU,
WHOM
HE
TOLD
ABOUT
STORIES
OF
VISHNU
AND
THE
LAKSHMI.
AMONG
THE
BOATS
BY
THE
RIVER,
HE
SLEPT
THIS
NIGHT,
AND
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING,
BEFORE
THE
FIRST
CUSTOMERS
CAME
INTO
HIS
SHOP,
HE
HAD
THE
BARBER'S
ASSISTANT
SHAVE
HIS
BEARD
AND
CUT
HIS
HAIR,
COMB
HIS
HAIR
AND
ANOINT
IT
WITH
FINE
OIL.
THEN
HE
WENT
TO
TAKE
HIS
BATH
IN
THE
RIVER.
WHEN
LATE
IN
THE
AFTERNOON,
BEAUTIFUL
KAMALA
APPROACHED
HER
GROVE
IN
HER
SEDAN-CHAIR,
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
STANDING
AT
THE
ENTRANCE,
MADE
A
BOW
AND
RECEIVED
THE
COURTESAN'S
GREETING.
BUT
THAT
SERVANT
WHO
WALKED
AT
THE
VERY
END
OF
HER
TRAIN
HE
MOTIONED
TO
HIM
AND
ASKED
HIM
TO
INFORM
HIS
MISTRESS
THAT
A
YOUNG
BRAHMAN
WOULD
WISH
TO
TALK
TO
HER.
AFTER
A
WHILE,
THE
SERVANT
RETURNED,
ASKED
HIM,
WHO
HAD
BEEN
WAITING,
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
CONDUCTED
HIM,
WHO
WAS
FOLLOWING
HIM,
WITHOUT
A
WORD
INTO
A
PAVILION,
WHERE
KAMALA
WAS
LYING
ON
A
COUCH,
AND
LEFT
HIM
ALONE
WITH
HER.
"WEREN'T
YOU
ALREADY
STANDING
OUT
THERE
YESTERDAY,
GREETING
ME?"
ASKED
KAMALA.
"IT'S
TRUE
THAT
I'VE
ALREADY
SEEN
AND
GREETED
YOU
YESTERDAY."
"BUT
DIDN'T
YOU
YESTERDAY
WEAR
A
BEARD,
AND
LONG
HAIR,
AND
DUST
IN
YOUR
HAIR?"
"YOU
HAVE
OBSERVED
WELL,
YOU
HAVE
SEEN
EVERYTHING.
YOU
HAVE
SEEN
SIDDHARTHA,
THE
SON
OF
A
BRAHMAN,
WHO
HAS
LEFT
HIS
HOME
TO
BECOME
A
SAMANA,
AND
WHO
HAS
BEEN
A
SAMANA
FOR
THREE
YEARS.
BUT
NOW,
I
HAVE
LEFT
THAT
PATH
AND
CAME
INTO
THIS
CITY,
AND
THE
FIRST
ONE
I
MET,
EVEN
BEFORE
I
HAD
ENTERED
THE
CITY,
WAS
YOU.
TO
SAY
THIS,
I
HAVE
COME
TO
YOU,
OH
KAMALA!
YOU
ARE
THE
FIRST
WOMAN
WHOM
SIDDHARTHA
IS
NOT
ADDRESSING
WITH
HIS
EYES
TURNED
TO
THE
GROUND.
NEVER
AGAIN
I
WANT
TO
TURN
MY
EYES
TO
THE
GROUND,
WHEN
I'M
COMING
ACROSS
A
BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN."
KAMALA
SMILED
AND
PLAYED
WITH
HER
FAN
OF
PEACOCKS'
FEATHERS.
AND
ASKED:
"AND
ONLY
TO
TELL
ME
THIS,
SIDDHARTHA
HAS
COME
TO
ME?"
"TO
TELL
YOU
THIS
AND
TO
THANK
YOU
FOR
BEING
SO
BEAUTIFUL.
AND
IF
IT
DOESN'T
DISPLEASE
YOU,
KAMALA,
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
YOU
TO
BE
MY
FRIEND
AND
TEACHER,
FOR
I
KNOW
NOTHING
YET
OF
THAT
ART
WHICH
YOU
HAVE
MASTERED
IN
THE
HIGHEST
DEGREE."
AT
THIS,
KAMALA
LAUGHED
ALOUD.
"NEVER
BEFORE
THIS
HAS
HAPPENED
TO
ME,
MY
FRIEND,
THAT
A
SAMANA
FROM
THE
FOREST
CAME
TO
ME
AND
WANTED
TO
LEARN
FROM
ME!
NEVER
BEFORE
THIS
HAS
HAPPENED
TO
ME,
THAT
A
SAMANA
CAME
TO
ME
WITH
LONG
HAIR
AND
AN
OLD,
TORN
LOIN-CLOTH!
MANY
YOUNG
MEN
COME
TO
ME,
AND
THERE
ARE
ALSO
SONS
OF
BRAHMANS
AMONG
THEM,
BUT
THEY
COME
IN
BEAUTIFUL
CLOTHES,
THEY
COME
IN
FINE
SHOES,
THEY
HAVE
PERFUME
IN
THEIR
HAIR
AND
MONEY
IN
THEIR
POUCHES.
THIS
IS,
OH
SAMANA,
HOW
THE
YOUNG
MEN
ARE
LIKE
WHO
COME
TO
ME."
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"ALREADY
I
AM
STARTING
TO
LEARN
FROM
YOU.
EVEN
YESTERDAY,
I
WAS
ALREADY
LEARNING.
I
HAVE
ALREADY
TAKEN
OFF
MY
BEARD,
HAVE
COMBED
THE
HAIR,
HAVE
OIL
IN
MY
HAIR.
THERE
IS
LITTLE
WHICH
IS
STILL
MISSING
IN
ME,
OH
EXCELLENT
ONE:
FINE
CLOTHES,
FINE
SHOES,
MONEY
IN
MY
POUCH.
YOU
SHALL
KNOW,
SIDDHARTHA
HAS
SET
HARDER
GOALS
FOR
HIMSELF
THAN
SUCH
TRIFLES,
AND
HE
HAS
REACHED
THEM.
HOW
SHOULDN'T
I
REACH
THAT
GOAL,
WHICH
I
HAVE
SET
FOR
MYSELF
YESTERDAY:
TO
BE
YOUR
FRIEND
AND
TO
LEARN
THE
JOYS
OF
LOVE
FROM
YOU!
YOU'LL
SEE
THAT
I'LL
LEARN
QUICKLY,
KAMALA,
I
HAVE
ALREADY
LEARNED
HARDER
THINGS
THAN
WHAT
YOU'RE
SUPPOSED
TO
TEACH
ME.
AND
NOW
LET'S
GET
TO
IT:
YOU
AREN'T
SATISFIED
WITH
SIDDHARTHA
AS
HE
IS,
WITH
OIL
IN
HIS
HAIR,
BUT
WITHOUT
CLOTHES,
WITHOUT
SHOES,
WITHOUT
MONEY?"
LAUGHING,
KAMALA
EXCLAIMED:
"NO,
MY
DEAR,
HE
DOESN'T
SATISFY
ME
YET.
CLOTHES
ARE
WHAT
HE
MUST
HAVE,
PRETTY
CLOTHES,
AND
SHOES,
PRETTY
SHOES,
AND
LOTS
OF
MONEY
IN
HIS
POUCH,
AND
GIFTS
FOR
KAMALA.
DO
YOU
KNOW
IT
NOW,
SAMANA
FROM
THE
FOREST?
DID
YOU
MARK
MY
WORDS?"
"YES,
I
HAVE
MARKED
YOUR
WORDS,"
SIDDHARTHA
EXCLAIMED.
"HOW
SHOULD
I
NOT
MARK
WORDS
WHICH
ARE
COMING
FROM
SUCH
A
MOUTH!
YOUR
MOUTH
IS
LIKE
A
FRESHLY
CRACKED
FIG,
KAMALA.
MY
MOUTH
IS
RED
AND
FRESH
AS
WELL,
IT
WILL
BE
A
SUITABLE
MATCH
FOR
YOURS,
YOU'LL
SEE.--BUT
TELL
ME,
BEAUTIFUL
KAMALA,
AREN'T
YOU
AT
ALL
AFRAID
OF
THE
SAMANA
FROM
THE
FOREST,
WHO
HAS
COME
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
MAKE
LOVE?"
"WHATEVER
FOR
SHOULD
I
BE
AFRAID
OF
A
SAMANA,
A
STUPID
SAMANA
FROM
THE
FOREST,
WHO
IS
COMING
FROM
THE
JACKALS
AND
DOESN'T
EVEN
KNOW
YET
WHAT
WOMEN
ARE?"
"OH,
HE'S
STRONG,
THE
SAMANA,
AND
HE
ISN'T
AFRAID
OF
ANYTHING.
HE
COULD
FORCE
YOU,
BEAUTIFUL
GIRL.
HE
COULD
KIDNAP
YOU.
HE
COULD
HURT
YOU."
"NO,
SAMANA,
I
AM
NOT
AFRAID
OF
THIS.
DID
ANY
SAMANA
OR
BRAHMAN
EVER
FEAR,
SOMEONE
MIGHT
COME
AND
GRAB
HIM
AND
STEAL
HIS
LEARNING,
AND
HIS
RELIGIOUS
DEVOTION,
AND
HIS
DEPTH
OF
THOUGHT?
NO,
FOR
THEY
ARE
HIS
VERY
OWN,
AND
HE
WOULD
ONLY
GIVE
AWAY
FROM
THOSE
WHATEVER
HE
IS
WILLING
TO
GIVE
AND
TO
WHOMEVER
HE
IS
WILLING
TO
GIVE.
LIKE
THIS
IT
IS,
PRECISELY
LIKE
THIS
IT
IS
ALSO
WITH
KAMALA
AND
WITH
THE
PLEASURES
OF
LOVE.
BEAUTIFUL
AND
RED
IS
KAMALA'S
MOUTH,
BUT
JUST
TRY
TO
KISS
IT
AGAINST
KAMALA'S
WILL,
AND
YOU
WILL
NOT
OBTAIN
A
SINGLE
DROP
OF
SWEETNESS
FROM
IT,
WHICH
KNOWS
HOW
TO
GIVE
SO
MANY
SWEET
THINGS!
YOU
ARE
LEARNING
EASILY,
SIDDHARTHA,
THUS
YOU
SHOULD
ALSO
LEARN
THIS:
LOVE
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
BY
BEGGING,
BUYING,
RECEIVING
IT
AS
A
GIFT,
FINDING
IT
IN
THE
STREET,
BUT
IT
CANNOT
BE
STOLEN.
IN
THIS,
YOU
HAVE
COME
UP
WITH
THE
WRONG
PATH.
NO,
IT
WOULD
BE
A
PITY,
IF
A
PRETTY
YOUNG
MAN
LIKE
YOU
WOULD
WANT
TO
TACKLE
IT
IN
SUCH
A
WRONG
MANNER."
SIDDHARTHA
BOWED
WITH
A
SMILE.
"IT
WOULD
BE
A
PITY,
KAMALA,
YOU
ARE
SO
RIGHT!
IT
WOULD
BE
SUCH
A
GREAT
PITY.
NO,
I
SHALL
NOT
LOSE
A
SINGLE
DROP
OF
SWEETNESS
FROM
YOUR
MOUTH,
NOR
YOU
FROM
MINE!
SO
IT
IS
SETTLED:
SIDDHARTHA
WILL
RETURN,
ONCE
HE'LL
HAVE
WHAT
HE
STILL
LACKS:
CLOTHES,
SHOES,
MONEY.
BUT
SPEAK,
LOVELY
KAMALA,
COULDN'T
YOU
STILL
GIVE
ME
ONE
SMALL
ADVICE?"
"AN
ADVICE?
WHY
NOT?
WHO
WOULDN'T
LIKE
TO
GIVE
AN
ADVICE
TO
A
POOR,
IGNORANT
SAMANA,
WHO
IS
COMING
FROM
THE
JACKALS
OF
THE
FOREST?"
"DEAR
KAMALA,
THUS
ADVISE
ME
WHERE
I
SHOULD
GO
TO,
THAT
I'LL
FIND
THESE
THREE
THINGS
MOST
QUICKLY?"
"FRIEND,
MANY
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
THIS.
YOU
MUST
DO
WHAT
YOU'VE
LEARNED
AND
ASK
FOR
MONEY,
CLOTHES,
AND
SHOES
IN
RETURN.
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
FOR
A
POOR
MAN
TO
OBTAIN
MONEY.
WHAT
MIGHT
YOU
BE
ABLE
TO
DO?"
"I
CAN
THINK.
I
CAN
WAIT.
I
CAN
FAST."
"NOTHING
ELSE?"
"NOTHING.
BUT
YES,
I
CAN
ALSO
WRITE
POETRY.
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
TO
GIVE
ME
A
KISS
FOR
A
POEM?"
"I
WOULD
LIKE
TO,
IF
I'LL
LIKE
YOUR
POEM.
WHAT
WOULD
BE
ITS
TITLE?"
SIDDHARTHA
SPOKE,
AFTER
HE
HAD
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
FOR
A
MOMENT,
THESE
VERSES:
INTO
HER
SHADY
GROVE
STEPPED
THE
PRETTY
KAMALA,
AT
THE
GROVE'S
ENTRANCE
STOOD
THE
BROWN
SAMANA.
DEEPLY,
SEEING
THE
LOTUS'S
BLOSSOM,
BOWED
THAT
MAN,
AND
SMILING
KAMALA
THANKED.
MORE
LOVELY,
THOUGHT
THE
YOUNG
MAN,
THAN
OFFERINGS
FOR
GODS,
MORE
LOVELY
IS
OFFERING
TO
PRETTY
KAMALA.
KAMALA
LOUDLY
CLAPPED
HER
HANDS,
SO
THAT
THE
GOLDEN
BRACELETS
CLANGED.
"BEAUTIFUL
ARE
YOUR
VERSES,
OH
BROWN
SAMANA,
AND
TRULY,
I'M
LOSING
NOTHING
WHEN
I'M
GIVING
YOU
A
KISS
FOR
THEM."
SHE
BECKONED
HIM
WITH
HER
EYES,
HE
TILTED
HIS
HEAD
SO
THAT
HIS
FACE
TOUCHED
HERS
AND
PLACED
HIS
MOUTH
ON
THAT
MOUTH
WHICH
WAS
LIKE
A
FRESHLY
CRACKED
FIG.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
KAMALA
KISSED
HIM,
AND
WITH
A
DEEP
ASTONISHMENT
SIDDHARTHA
FELT
HOW
SHE
TAUGHT
HIM,
HOW
WISE
SHE
WAS,
HOW
SHE
CONTROLLED
HIM,
REJECTED
HIM,
LURED
HIM,
AND
HOW
AFTER
THIS
FIRST
ONE
THERE
WAS
TO
BE
A
LONG,
A
WELL
ORDERED,
WELL
TESTED
SEQUENCE
OF
KISSES,
EVERYONE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
OTHERS,
HE
WAS
STILL
TO
RECEIVE.
BREATHING
DEEPLY,
HE
REMAINED
STANDING
WHERE
HE
WAS,
AND
WAS
IN
THIS
MOMENT
ASTONISHED
LIKE
A
CHILD
ABOUT
THE
CORNUCOPIA
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
THINGS
WORTH
LEARNING,
WHICH
REVEALED
ITSELF
BEFORE
HIS
EYES.
"VERY
BEAUTIFUL
ARE
YOUR
VERSES,"
EXCLAIMED
KAMALA,
"IF
I
WAS
RICH,
I
WOULD
GIVE
YOU
PIECES
OF
GOLD
FOR
THEM.
BUT
IT
WILL
BE
DIFFICULT
FOR
YOU
TO
EARN
THUS
MUCH
MONEY
WITH
VERSES
AS
YOU
NEED.
FOR
YOU
NEED
A
LOT
OF
MONEY,
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
KAMALA'S
FRIEND."
"THE
WAY
YOU'RE
ABLE
TO
KISS,
KAMALA!"
STAMMERED
SIDDHARTHA.
"YES,
THIS
I
AM
ABLE
TO
DO,
THEREFORE
I
DO
NOT
LACK
CLOTHES,
SHOES,
BRACELETS,
AND
ALL
BEAUTIFUL
THINGS.
BUT
WHAT
WILL
BECOME
OF
YOU?
AREN'T
YOU
ABLE
TO
DO
ANYTHING
ELSE
BUT
THINKING,
FASTING,
MAKING
POETRY?"
"I
ALSO
KNOW
THE
SACRIFICIAL
SONGS,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA,
"BUT
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
SING
THEM
ANY
MORE.
I
ALSO
KNOW
MAGIC
SPELLS,
BUT
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
SPEAK
THEM
ANY
MORE.
I
HAVE
READ
THE
SCRIPTURES--"
"STOP,"
KAMALA
INTERRUPTED
HIM.
"YOU'RE
ABLE
TO
READ?
AND
WRITE?"
"CERTAINLY,
I
CAN
DO
THIS.
MANY
PEOPLE
CAN
DO
THIS."
"MOST
PEOPLE
CAN'T.
I
ALSO
CAN'T
DO
IT.
IT
IS
VERY
GOOD
THAT
YOU'RE
ABLE
TO
READ
AND
WRITE,
VERY
GOOD.
YOU
WILL
ALSO
STILL
FIND
USE
FOR
THE
MAGIC
SPELLS."
IN
THIS
MOMENT,
A
MAID
CAME
RUNNING
IN
AND
WHISPERED
A
MESSAGE
INTO
HER
MISTRESS'S
EAR.
"THERE'S
A
VISITOR
FOR
ME,"
EXCLAIMED
KAMALA.
"HURRY
AND
GET
YOURSELF
AWAY,
SIDDHARTHA,
NOBODY
MAY
SEE
YOU
IN
HERE,
REMEMBER
THIS!
TOMORROW,
I'LL
SEE
YOU
AGAIN."
BUT
TO
THE
MAID
SHE
GAVE
THE
ORDER
TO
GIVE
THE
PIOUS
BRAHMAN
WHITE
UPPER
GARMENTS.
WITHOUT
FULLY
UNDERSTANDING
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
TO
HIM,
SIDDHARTHA
FOUND
HIMSELF
BEING
DRAGGED
AWAY
BY
THE
MAID,
BROUGHT
INTO
A
GARDEN-HOUSE
AVOIDING
THE
DIRECT
PATH,
BEING
GIVEN
UPPER
GARMENTS
AS
A
GIFT,
LED
INTO
THE
BUSHES,
AND
URGENTLY
ADMONISHED
TO
GET
HIMSELF
OUT
OF
THE
GROVE
AS
SOON
AS
POSSIBLE
WITHOUT
BEING
SEEN.
CONTENTLY,
HE
DID
AS
HE
HAD
BEEN
TOLD.
BEING
ACCUSTOMED
TO
THE
FOREST,
HE
MANAGED
TO
GET
OUT
OF
THE
GROVE
AND
OVER
THE
HEDGE
WITHOUT
MAKING
A
SOUND.
CONTENTLY,
HE
RETURNED
TO
THE
CITY,
CARRYING
THE
ROLLED
UP
GARMENTS
UNDER
HIS
ARM.
AT
THE
INN,
WHERE
TRAVELLERS
STAY,
HE
POSITIONED
HIMSELF
BY
THE
DOOR,
WITHOUT
WORDS
HE
ASKED
FOR
FOOD,
WITHOUT
A
WORD
HE
ACCEPTED
A
PIECE
OF
RICE-CAKE.
PERHAPS
AS
SOON
AS
TOMORROW,
HE
THOUGHT,
I
WILL
ASK
NO
ONE
FOR
FOOD
ANY
MORE.
SUDDENLY,
PRIDE
FLARED
UP
IN
HIM.
HE
WAS
NO
SAMANA
ANY
MORE,
IT
WAS
NO
LONGER
BECOMING
TO
HIM
TO
BEG.
HE
GAVE
THE
RICE-CAKE
TO
A
DOG
AND
REMAINED
WITHOUT
FOOD.
"SIMPLE
IS
THE
LIFE
WHICH
PEOPLE
LEAD
IN
THIS
WORLD
HERE,"
THOUGHT
SIDDHARTHA.
"IT
PRESENTS
NO
DIFFICULTIES.
EVERYTHING
WAS
DIFFICULT,
TOILSOME,
AND
ULTIMATELY
HOPELESS,
WHEN
I
WAS
STILL
A
SAMANA.
NOW,
EVERYTHING
IS
EASY,
EASY
LIKE
THAT
LESSONS
IN
KISSING,
WHICH
KAMALA
IS
GIVING
ME.
I
NEED
CLOTHES
AND
MONEY,
NOTHING
ELSE;
THIS
A
SMALL,
NEAR
GOALS,
THEY
WON'T
MAKE
A
PERSON
LOSE
ANY
SLEEP."
HE
HAD
ALREADY
DISCOVERED
KAMALA'S
HOUSE
IN
THE
CITY
LONG
BEFORE,
THERE
HE
TURNED
UP
THE
FOLLOWING
DAY.
"THINGS
ARE
WORKING
OUT
WELL,"
SHE
CALLED
OUT
TO
HIM.
"THEY
ARE
EXPECTING
YOU
AT
KAMASWAMI'S,
HE
IS
THE
RICHEST
MERCHANT
OF
THE
CITY.
IF
HE'LL
LIKE
YOU,
HE'LL
ACCEPT
YOU
INTO
HIS
SERVICE.
BE
SMART,
BROWN
SAMANA.
I
HAD
OTHERS
TELL
HIM
ABOUT
YOU.
BE
POLITE
TOWARDS
HIM,
HE
IS
VERY
POWERFUL.
BUT
DON'T
BE
TOO
MODEST!
I
DO
NOT
WANT
YOU
TO
BECOME
HIS
SERVANT,
YOU
SHALL
BECOME
HIS
EQUAL,
OR
ELSE
I
WON'T
BE
SATISFIED
WITH
YOU.
KAMASWAMI
IS
STARTING
TO
GET
OLD
AND
LAZY.
IF
HE'LL
LIKE
YOU,
HE'LL
ENTRUST
YOU
WITH
A
LOT."
SIDDHARTHA
THANKED
HER
AND
LAUGHED,
AND
WHEN
SHE
FOUND
OUT
THAT
HE
HAD
NOT
EATEN
ANYTHING
YESTERDAY
AND
TODAY,
SHE
SENT
FOR
BREAD
AND
FRUITS
AND
TREATED
HIM
TO
IT.
"YOU'VE
BEEN
LUCKY,"
SHE
SAID
WHEN
THEY
PARTED,
"I'M
OPENING
ONE
DOOR
AFTER
ANOTHER
FOR
YOU.
HOW
COME?
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
SPELL?"
SIDDHARTHA
SAID:
"YESTERDAY,
I
TOLD
YOU
I
KNEW
HOW
TO
THINK,
TO
WAIT,
AND
TO
FAST,
BUT
YOU
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
OF
NO
USE.
BUT
IT
IS
USEFUL
FOR
MANY
THINGS,
KAMALA,
YOU'LL
SEE.
YOU'LL
SEE
THAT
THE
STUPID
SAMANAS
ARE
LEARNING
AND
ABLE
TO
DO
MANY
PRETTY
THINGS
IN
THE
FOREST,
WHICH
THE
LIKES
OF
YOU
AREN'T
CAPABLE
OF.
THE
DAY
BEFORE
YESTERDAY,
I
WAS
STILL
A
SHAGGY
BEGGAR,
AS
SOON
AS
YESTERDAY
I
HAVE
KISSED
KAMALA,
AND
SOON
I'LL
BE
A
MERCHANT
AND
HAVE
MONEY
AND
ALL
THOSE
THINGS
YOU
INSIST
UPON."
"WELL
YES,"
SHE
ADMITTED.
"BUT
WHERE
WOULD
YOU
BE
WITHOUT
ME?
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
BE,
IF
KAMALA
WASN'T
HELPING
YOU?"
"DEAR
KAMALA,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA
AND
STRAIGHTENED
UP
TO
HIS
FULL
HEIGHT,
"WHEN
I
CAME
TO
YOU
INTO
YOUR
GROVE,
I
DID
THE
FIRST
STEP.
IT
WAS
MY
RESOLUTION
TO
LEARN
LOVE
FROM
THIS
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN.
FROM
THAT
MOMENT
ON
WHEN
I
HAD
MADE
THIS
RESOLUTION,
I
ALSO
KNEW
THAT
I
WOULD
CARRY
IT
OUT.
I
KNEW
THAT
YOU
WOULD
HELP
ME,
AT
YOUR
FIRST
GLANCE
AT
THE
ENTRANCE
OF
THE
GROVE
I
ALREADY
KNEW
IT."
"BUT
WHAT
IF
I
HADN'T
BEEN
WILLING?"
"YOU
WERE
WILLING.
LOOK,
KAMALA:
WHEN
YOU
THROW
A
ROCK
INTO
THE
WATER,
IT
WILL
SPEED
ON
THE
FASTEST
COURSE
TO
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
WATER.
THIS
IS
HOW
IT
IS
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
HAS
A
GOAL,
A
RESOLUTION.
SIDDHARTHA
DOES
NOTHING,
HE
WAITS,
HE
THINKS,
HE
FASTS,
BUT
HE
PASSES
THROUGH
THE
THINGS
OF
THE
WORLD
LIKE
A
ROCK
THROUGH
WATER,
WITHOUT
DOING
ANYTHING,
WITHOUT
STIRRING;
HE
IS
DRAWN,
HE
LETS
HIMSELF
FALL.
HIS
GOAL
ATTRACTS
HIM,
BECAUSE
HE
DOESN'T
LET
ANYTHING
ENTER
HIS
SOUL
WHICH
MIGHT
OPPOSE
THE
GOAL.
THIS
IS
WHAT
SIDDHARTHA
HAS
LEARNED
AMONG
THE
SAMANAS.
THIS
IS
WHAT
FOOLS
CALL
MAGIC
AND
OF
WHICH
THEY
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
EFFECTED
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
DAEMONS.
NOTHING
IS
EFFECTED
BY
DAEMONS,
THERE
ARE
NO
DAEMONS.
EVERYONE
CAN
PERFORM
MAGIC,
EVERYONE
CAN
REACH
HIS
GOALS,
IF
HE
IS
ABLE
TO
THINK,
IF
HE
IS
ABLE
TO
WAIT,
IF
HE
IS
ABLE
TO
FAST."
KAMALA
LISTENED
TO
HIM.
SHE
LOVED
HIS
VOICE,
SHE
LOVED
THE
LOOK
FROM
HIS
EYES.
"PERHAPS
IT
IS
SO,"
SHE
SAID
QUIETLY,
"AS
YOU
SAY,
FRIEND.
BUT
PERHAPS
IT
IS
ALSO
LIKE
THIS:
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
IS
A
HANDSOME
MAN,
THAT
HIS
GLANCE
PLEASES
THE
WOMEN,
THAT
THEREFORE
GOOD
FORTUNE
IS
COMING
TOWARDS
HIM."
WITH
ONE
KISS,
SIDDHARTHA
BID
HIS
FAREWELL.
"I
WISH
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
THIS
WAY,
MY
TEACHER;
THAT
MY
GLANCE
SHALL
PLEASE
YOU,
THAT
ALWAYS
GOOD
FORTUNE
SHALL
COME
TO
ME
OUT
OF
YOUR
DIRECTION!"
WITH
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE
SIDDHARTHA
WENT
TO
KAMASWAMI
THE
MERCHANT,
HE
WAS
DIRECTED
INTO
A
RICH
HOUSE,
SERVANTS
LED
HIM
BETWEEN
PRECIOUS
CARPETS
INTO
A
CHAMBER,
WHERE
HE
AWAITED
THE
MASTER
OF
THE
HOUSE.
KAMASWAMI
ENTERED,
A
SWIFTLY,
SMOOTHLY
MOVING
MAN
WITH
VERY
GRAY
HAIR,
WITH
VERY
INTELLIGENT,
CAUTIOUS
EYES,
WITH
A
GREEDY
MOUTH.
POLITELY,
THE
HOST
AND
THE
GUEST
GREETED
ONE
ANOTHER.
"I
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD,"
THE
MERCHANT
BEGAN,
"THAT
YOU
WERE
A
BRAHMAN,
A
LEARNED
MAN,
BUT
THAT
YOU
SEEK
TO
BE
IN
THE
SERVICE
OF
A
MERCHANT.
MIGHT
YOU
HAVE
BECOME
DESTITUTE,
BRAHMAN,
SO
THAT
YOU
SEEK
TO
SERVE?"
"NO,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA,
"I
HAVE
NOT
BECOME
DESTITUTE
AND
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
DESTITUTE.
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
THAT
I'M
COMING
FROM
THE
SAMANAS,
WITH
WHOM
I
HAVE
LIVED
FOR
A
LONG
TIME."
"IF
YOU'RE
COMING
FROM
THE
SAMANAS,
HOW
COULD
YOU
BE
ANYTHING
BUT
DESTITUTE?
AREN'T
THE
SAMANAS
ENTIRELY
WITHOUT
POSSESSIONS?"
"I
AM
WITHOUT
POSSESSIONS,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA,
"IF
THIS
IS
WHAT
YOU
MEAN.
SURELY,
I
AM
WITHOUT
POSSESSIONS.
BUT
I
AM
SO
VOLUNTARILY,
AND
THEREFORE
I
AM
NOT
DESTITUTE."
"BUT
WHAT
ARE
YOU
PLANNING
TO
LIVE
OF,
BEING
WITHOUT
POSSESSIONS?"
"I
HAVEN'T
THOUGHT
OF
THIS
YET,
SIR.
FOR
MORE
THAN
THREE
YEARS,
I
HAVE
BEEN
WITHOUT
POSSESSIONS,
AND
HAVE
NEVER
THOUGHT
ABOUT
OF
WHAT
I
SHOULD
LIVE."
"SO
YOU'VE
LIVED
OF
THE
POSSESSIONS
OF
OTHERS."
"PRESUMABLE
THIS
IS
HOW
IT
IS.
AFTER
ALL,
A
MERCHANT
ALSO
LIVES
OF
WHAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
OWN."
"WELL
SAID.
BUT
HE
WOULDN'T
TAKE
ANYTHING
FROM
ANOTHER
PERSON
FOR
NOTHING;
HE
WOULD
GIVE
HIS
MERCHANDISE
IN
RETURN."
"SO
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
INDEED.
EVERYONE
TAKES,
EVERYONE
GIVES,
SUCH
IS
LIFE."
"BUT
IF
YOU
DON'T
MIND
ME
ASKING:
BEING
WITHOUT
POSSESSIONS,
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
TO
GIVE?"
"EVERYONE
GIVES
WHAT
HE
HAS.
THE
WARRIOR
GIVES
STRENGTH,
THE
MERCHANT
GIVES
MERCHANDISE,
THE
TEACHER
TEACHINGS,
THE
FARMER
RICE,
THE
FISHER
FISH."
"YES
INDEED.
AND
WHAT
IS
IT
NOW
WHAT
YOU'VE
GOT
TO
GIVE?
WHAT
IS
IT
THAT
YOU'VE
LEARNED,
WHAT
YOU'RE
ABLE
TO
DO?"
"I
CAN
THINK.
I
CAN
WAIT.
I
CAN
FAST."
"THAT'S
EVERYTHING?"
"I
BELIEVE,
THAT'S
EVERYTHING!"
"AND
WHAT'S
THE
USE
OF
THAT?
FOR
EXAMPLE,
THE
FASTING--WHAT
IS
IT
GOOD
FOR?"
"IT
IS
VERY
GOOD,
SIR.
WHEN
A
PERSON
HAS
NOTHING
TO
EAT,
FASTING
IS
THE
SMARTEST
THING
HE
COULD
DO.
WHEN,
FOR
EXAMPLE,
SIDDHARTHA
HADN'T
LEARNED
TO
FAST,
HE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
ACCEPT
ANY
KIND
OF
SERVICE
BEFORE
THIS
DAY
IS
UP,
WHETHER
IT
MAY
BE
WITH
YOU
OR
WHEREVER,
BECAUSE
HUNGER
WOULD
FORCE
HIM
TO
DO
SO.
BUT
LIKE
THIS,
SIDDHARTHA
CAN
WAIT
CALMLY,
HE
KNOWS
NO
IMPATIENCE,
HE
KNOWS
NO
EMERGENCY,
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
HE
CAN
ALLOW
HUNGER
TO
BESIEGE
HIM
AND
CAN
LAUGH
ABOUT
IT.
THIS,
SIR,
IS
WHAT
FASTING
IS
GOOD
FOR."
"YOU'RE
RIGHT,
SAMANA.
WAIT
FOR
A
MOMENT."
KAMASWAMI
LEFT
THE
ROOM
AND
RETURNED
WITH
A
SCROLL,
WHICH
HE
HANDED
TO
HIS
GUEST
WHILE
ASKING:
"CAN
YOU
READ
THIS?"
SIDDHARTHA
LOOKED
AT
THE
SCROLL,
ON
WHICH
A
SALES-CONTRACT
HAD
BEEN
WRITTEN
DOWN,
AND
BEGAN
TO
READ
OUT
ITS
CONTENTS.
"EXCELLENT,"
SAID
KAMASWAMI.
"AND
WOULD
YOU
WRITE
SOMETHING
FOR
ME
ON
THIS
PIECE
OF
PAPER?"
HE
HANDED
HIM
A
PIECE
OF
PAPER
AND
A
PEN,
AND
SIDDHARTHA
WROTE
AND
RETURNED
THE
PAPER.
KAMASWAMI
READ:
"WRITING
IS
GOOD,
THINKING
IS
BETTER.
BEING
SMART
IS
GOOD,
BEING
PATIENT
IS
BETTER."
"IT
IS
EXCELLENT
HOW
YOU'RE
ABLE
TO
WRITE,"
THE
MERCHANT
PRAISED
HIM.
"MANY
A
THING
WE
WILL
STILL
HAVE
TO
DISCUSS
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER.
FOR
TODAY,
I'M
ASKING
YOU
TO
BE
MY
GUEST
AND
TO
LIVE
IN
THIS
HOUSE."
SIDDHARTHA
THANKED
AND
ACCEPTED,
AND
LIVED
IN
THE
DEALERS
HOUSE
FROM
NOW
ON.
CLOTHES
WERE
BROUGHT
TO
HIM,
AND
SHOES,
AND
EVERY
DAY,
A
SERVANT
PREPARED
A
BATH
FOR
HIM.
TWICE
A
DAY,
A
PLENTIFUL
MEAL
WAS
SERVED,
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
ONLY
ATE
ONCE
A
DAY,
AND
ATE
NEITHER
MEAT
NOR
DID
HE
DRINK
WINE.
KAMASWAMI
TOLD
HIM
ABOUT
HIS
TRADE,
SHOWED
HIM
THE
MERCHANDISE
AND
STORAGE-ROOMS,
SHOWED
HIM
CALCULATIONS.
SIDDHARTHA
GOT
TO
KNOW
MANY
NEW
THINGS,
HE
HEARD
A
LOT
AND
SPOKE
LITTLE.
AND
THINKING
OF
KAMALA'S
WORDS,
HE
WAS
NEVER
SUBSERVIENT
TO
THE
MERCHANT,
FORCED
HIM
TO
TREAT
HIM
AS
AN
EQUAL,
YES
EVEN
MORE
THAN
AN
EQUAL.
KAMASWAMI
CONDUCTED
HIS
BUSINESS
WITH
CARE
AND
OFTEN
WITH
PASSION,
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
LOOKED
UPON
ALL
OF
THIS
AS
IF
IT
WAS
A
GAME,
THE
RULES
OF
WHICH
HE
TRIED
HARD
TO
LEARN
PRECISELY,
BUT
THE
CONTENTS
OF
WHICH
DID
NOT
TOUCH
HIS
HEART.
HE
WAS
NOT
IN
KAMASWAMI'S
HOUSE
FOR
LONG,
WHEN
HE
ALREADY
TOOK
PART
IN
HIS
LANDLORDS
BUSINESS.
BUT
DAILY,
AT
THE
HOUR
APPOINTED
BY
HER,
HE
VISITED
BEAUTIFUL
KAMALA,
WEARING
PRETTY
CLOTHES,
FINE
SHOES,
AND
SOON
HE
BROUGHT
HER
GIFTS
AS
WELL.
MUCH
HE
LEARNED
FROM
HER
RED,
SMART
MOUTH.
MUCH
HE
LEARNED
FROM
HER
TENDER,
SUPPLE
HAND.
HIM,
WHO
WAS,
REGARDING
LOVE,
STILL
A
BOY
AND
HAD
A
TENDENCY
TO
PLUNGE
BLINDLY
AND
INSATIABLY
INTO
LUST
LIKE
INTO
A
BOTTOMLESS
PIT,
HIM
SHE
TAUGHT,
THOROUGHLY
STARTING
WITH
THE
BASICS,
ABOUT
THAT
SCHOOL
OF
THOUGHT
WHICH
TEACHES
THAT
PLEASURE
CANNOT
BE
TAKEN
WITHOUT
GIVING
PLEASURE,
AND
THAT
EVERY
GESTURE,
EVERY
CARESS,
EVERY
TOUCH,
EVERY
LOOK,
EVERY
SPOT
OF
THE
BODY,
HOWEVER
SMALL
IT
WAS,
HAD
ITS
SECRET,
WHICH
WOULD
BRING
HAPPINESS
TO
THOSE
WHO
KNOW
ABOUT
IT
AND
UNLEASH
IT.
SHE
TAUGHT
HIM,
THAT
LOVERS
MUST
NOT
PART
FROM
ONE
ANOTHER
AFTER
CELEBRATING
LOVE,
WITHOUT
ONE
ADMIRING
THE
OTHER,
WITHOUT
BEING
JUST
AS
DEFEATED
AS
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
VICTORIOUS,
SO
THAT
WITH
NONE
OF
THEM
SHOULD
START
FEELING
FED
UP
OR
BORED
AND
GET
THAT
EVIL
FEELING
OF
HAVING
ABUSED
OR
HAVING
BEEN
ABUSED.
WONDERFUL
HOURS
HE
SPENT
WITH
THE
BEAUTIFUL
AND
SMART
ARTIST,
BECAME
HER
STUDENT,
HER
LOVER,
HER
FRIEND.
HERE
WITH
KAMALA
WAS
THE
WORTH
AND
PURPOSE
OF
HIS
PRESENT
LIFE,
NIT
WITH
THE
BUSINESS
OF
KAMASWAMI.
THE
MERCHANT
PASSED
TO
DUTIES
OF
WRITING
IMPORTANT
LETTERS
AND
CONTRACTS
ON
TO
HIM
AND
GOT
INTO
THE
HABIT
OF
DISCUSSING
ALL
IMPORTANT
AFFAIRS
WITH
HIM.
HE
SOON
SAW
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
KNEW
LITTLE
ABOUT
RICE
AND
WOOL,
SHIPPING
AND
TRADE,
BUT
THAT
HE
ACTED
IN
A
FORTUNATE
MANNER,
AND
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
SURPASSED
HIM,
THE
MERCHANT,
IN
CALMNESS
AND
EQUANIMITY,
AND
IN
THE
ART
OF
LISTENING
AND
DEEPLY
UNDERSTANDING
PREVIOUSLY
UNKNOWN
PEOPLE.
"THIS
BRAHMAN,"
HE
SAID
TO
A
FRIEND,
"IS
NO
PROPER
MERCHANT
AND
WILL
NEVER
BE
ONE,
THERE
IS
NEVER
ANY
PASSION
IN
HIS
SOUL
WHEN
HE
CONDUCTS
OUR
BUSINESS.
BUT
HE
HAS
THAT
MYSTERIOUS
QUALITY
OF
THOSE
PEOPLE
TO
WHOM
SUCCESS
COMES
ALL
BY
ITSELF,
WHETHER
THIS
MAY
BE
A
GOOD
STAR
OF
HIS
BIRTH,
MAGIC,
OR
SOMETHING
HE
HAS
LEARNED
AMONG
SAMANAS.
HE
ALWAYS
SEEMS
TO
BE
MERELY
PLAYING
WITH
OUT
BUSINESS-AFFAIRS,
THEY
NEVER
FULLY
BECOME
A
PART
OF
HIM,
THEY
NEVER
RULE
OVER
HIM,
HE
IS
NEVER
AFRAID
OF
FAILURE,
HE
IS
NEVER
UPSET
BY
A
LOSS."
THE
FRIEND
ADVISED
THE
MERCHANT:
"GIVE
HIM
FROM
THE
BUSINESS
HE
CONDUCTS
FOR
YOU
A
THIRD
OF
THE
PROFITS,
BUT
LET
HIM
ALSO
BE
LIABLE
FOR
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
OF
THE
LOSSES,
WHEN
THERE
IS
A
LOSS.
THEN,
HE'LL
BECOME
MORE
ZEALOUS."
KAMASWAMI
FOLLOWED
THE
ADVICE.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
CARED
LITTLE
ABOUT
THIS.
WHEN
HE
MADE
A
PROFIT,
HE
ACCEPTED
IT
WITH
EQUANIMITY;
WHEN
HE
MADE
LOSSES,
HE
LAUGHED
AND
SAID:
"WELL,
LOOK
AT
THIS,
SO
THIS
ONE
TURNED
OUT
BADLY!"
IT
SEEMED
INDEED,
AS
IF
HE
DID
NOT
CARE
ABOUT
THE
BUSINESS.
AT
ONE
TIME,
HE
TRAVELLED
TO
A
VILLAGE
TO
BUY
A
LARGE
HARVEST
OF
RICE
THERE.
BUT
WHEN
HE
GOT
THERE,
THE
RICE
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
SOLD
TO
ANOTHER
MERCHANT.
NEVERTHELESS,
SIDDHARTHA
STAYED
FOR
SEVERAL
DAYS
IN
THAT
VILLAGE,
TREATED
THE
FARMERS
FOR
A
DRINK,
GAVE
COPPER-COINS
TO
THEIR
CHILDREN,
JOINED
IN
THE
CELEBRATION
OF
A
WEDDING,
AND
RETURNED
EXTREMELY
SATISFIED
FROM
HIS
TRIP.
KAMASWAMI
HELD
AGAINST
HIM
THAT
HE
HAD
NOT
TURNED
BACK
RIGHT
AWAY,
THAT
HE
HAD
WASTED
TIME
AND
MONEY.
SIDDHARTHA
ANSWERED:
"STOP
SCOLDING,
DEAR
FRIEND!
NOTHING
WAS
EVER
ACHIEVED
BY
SCOLDING.
IF
A
LOSS
HAS
OCCURRED,
LET
ME
BEAR
THAT
LOSS.
I
AM
VERY
SATISFIED
WITH
THIS
TRIP.
I
HAVE
GOTTEN
TO
KNOW
MANY
KINDS
OF
PEOPLE,
A
BRAHMAN
HAS
BECOME
MY
FRIEND,
CHILDREN
HAVE
SAT
ON
MY
KNEES,
FARMERS
HAVE
SHOWN
ME
THEIR
FIELDS,
NOBODY
KNEW
THAT
I
WAS
A
MERCHANT."
"THAT'S
ALL
VERY
NICE,"
EXCLAIMED
KAMASWAMI
INDIGNANTLY,
"BUT
IN
FACT,
YOU
ARE
A
MERCHANT
AFTER
ALL,
ONE
OUGHT
TO
THINK!
OR
MIGHT
YOU
HAVE
ONLY
TRAVELLED
FOR
YOUR
AMUSEMENT?"
"SURELY,"
SIDDHARTHA
LAUGHED,
"SURELY
I
HAVE
TRAVELLED
FOR
MY
AMUSEMENT.
FOR
WHAT
ELSE?
I
HAVE
GOTTEN
TO
KNOW
PEOPLE
AND
PLACES,
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
KINDNESS
AND
TRUST,
I
HAVE
FOUND
FRIENDSHIP.
LOOK,
MY
DEAR,
IF
I
HAD
BEEN
KAMASWAMI,
I
WOULD
HAVE
TRAVELLED
BACK,
BEING
ANNOYED
AND
IN
A
HURRY,
AS
SOON
AS
I
HAD
SEEN
THAT
MY
PURCHASE
HAD
BEEN
RENDERED
IMPOSSIBLE,
AND
TIME
AND
MONEY
WOULD
INDEED
HAVE
BEEN
LOST.
BUT
LIKE
THIS,
I'VE
HAD
A
FEW
GOOD
DAYS,
I'VE
LEARNED,
HAD
JOY,
I'VE
NEITHER
HARMED
MYSELF
NOR
OTHERS
BY
ANNOYANCE
AND
HASTINESS.
AND
IF
I'LL
EVER
RETURN
THERE
AGAIN,
PERHAPS
TO
BUY
AN
UPCOMING
HARVEST,
OR
FOR
WHATEVER
PURPOSE
IT
MIGHT
BE,
FRIENDLY
PEOPLE
WILL
RECEIVE
ME
IN
A
FRIENDLY
AND
HAPPY
MANNER,
AND
I
WILL
PRAISE
MYSELF
FOR
NOT
SHOWING
ANY
HURRY
AND
DISPLEASURE
AT
THAT
TIME.
SO,
LEAVE
IT
AS
IT
IS,
MY
FRIEND,
AND
DON'T
HARM
YOURSELF
BY
SCOLDING!
IF
THE
DAY
WILL
COME,
WHEN
YOU
WILL
SEE:
THIS
SIDDHARTHA
IS
HARMING
ME,
THEN
SPEAK
A
WORD
AND
SIDDHARTHA
WILL
GO
ON
HIS
OWN
PATH.
BUT
UNTIL
THEN,
LET'S
BE
SATISFIED
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER."
FUTILE
WERE
ALSO
THE
MERCHANT'S
ATTEMPTS,
TO
CONVINCE
SIDDHARTHA
THAT
HE
SHOULD
EAT
HIS
BREAD.
SIDDHARTHA
ATE
HIS
OWN
BREAD,
OR
RATHER
THEY
BOTH
ATE
OTHER
PEOPLE'S
BREAD,
ALL
PEOPLE'S
BREAD.
SIDDHARTHA
NEVER
LISTENED
TO
KAMASWAMI'S
WORRIES
AND
KAMASWAMI
HAD
MANY
WORRIES.
WHETHER
THERE
WAS
A
BUSINESS-DEAL
GOING
ON
WHICH
WAS
IN
DANGER
OF
FAILING,
OR
WHETHER
A
SHIPMENT
OF
MERCHANDISE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
LOST,
OR
A
DEBTOR
SEEMED
TO
BE
UNABLE
TO
PAY,
KAMASWAMI
COULD
NEVER
CONVINCE
HIS
PARTNER
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
USEFUL
TO
UTTER
A
FEW
WORDS
OF
WORRY
OR
ANGER,
TO
HAVE
WRINKLES
ON
THE
FOREHEAD,
TO
SLEEP
BADLY.
WHEN,
ONE
DAY,
KAMASWAMI
HELD
AGAINST
HIM
THAT
HE
HAD
LEARNED
EVERYTHING
HE
KNEW
FROM
HIM,
HE
REPLIED:
"WOULD
YOU
PLEASE
NOT
KID
ME
WITH
SUCH
JOKES!
WHAT
I'VE
LEARNED
FROM
YOU
IS
HOW
MUCH
A
BASKET
OF
FISH
COSTS
AND
HOW
MUCH
INTERESTS
MAY
BE
CHARGED
ON
LOANED
MONEY.
THESE
ARE
YOUR
AREAS
OF
EXPERTISE.
I
HAVEN'T
LEARNED
TO
THINK
FROM
YOU,
MY
DEAR
KAMASWAMI,
YOU
OUGHT
TO
BE
THE
ONE
SEEKING
TO
LEARN
FROM
ME."
INDEED
HIS
SOUL
WAS
NOT
WITH
THE
TRADE.
THE
BUSINESS
WAS
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
PROVIDE
HIM
WITH
THE
MONEY
FOR
KAMALA,
AND
IT
EARNED
HIM
MUCH
MORE
THAN
HE
NEEDED.
BESIDES
FROM
THIS,
SIDDHARTHA'S
INTEREST
AND
CURIOSITY
WAS
ONLY
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
PEOPLE,
WHOSE
BUSINESSES,
CRAFTS,
WORRIES,
PLEASURES,
AND
ACTS
OF
FOOLISHNESS
USED
TO
BE
AS
ALIEN
AND
DISTANT
TO
HIM
AS
THE
MOON.
HOWEVER
EASILY
HE
SUCCEEDED
IN
TALKING
TO
ALL
OF
THEM,
IN
LIVING
WITH
ALL
OF
THEM,
IN
LEARNING
FROM
ALL
OF
THEM,
HE
WAS
STILL
AWARE
THAT
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
WHICH
SEPARATED
HIM
FROM
THEM
AND
THIS
SEPARATING
FACTOR
WAS
HIM
BEING
A
SAMANA.
HE
SAW
MANKIND
GOING
THROUGH
LIFE
IN
A
CHILDLIKE
OR
ANIMALLIKE
MANNER,
WHICH
HE
LOVED
AND
ALSO
DESPISED
AT
THE
SAME
TIME.
HE
SAW
THEM
TOILING,
SAW
THEM
SUFFERING,
AND
BECOMING
GRAY
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
THINGS
WHICH
SEEMED
TO
HIM
TO
ENTIRELY
UNWORTHY
OF
THIS
PRICE,
FOR
MONEY,
FOR
LITTLE
PLEASURES,
FOR
BEING
SLIGHTLY
HONOURED,
HE
SAW
THEM
SCOLDING
AND
INSULTING
EACH
OTHER,
HE
SAW
THEM
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
PAIN
AT
WHICH
A
SAMANA
WOULD
ONLY
SMILE,
AND
SUFFERING
BECAUSE
OF
DEPRIVATIONS
WHICH
A
SAMANA
WOULD
NOT
FEEL.
HE
WAS
OPEN
TO
EVERYTHING,
THESE
PEOPLE
BROUGHT
HIS
WAY.
WELCOME
WAS
THE
MERCHANT
WHO
OFFERED
HIM
LINEN
FOR
SALE,
WELCOME
WAS
THE
DEBTOR
WHO
SOUGHT
ANOTHER
LOAN,
WELCOME
WAS
THE
BEGGAR
WHO
TOLD
HIM
FOR
ONE
HOUR
THE
STORY
OF
HIS
POVERTY
AND
WHO
WAS
NOT
HALF
AS
POOR
AS
ANY
GIVEN
SAMANA.
HE
DID
NOT
TREAT
THE
RICH
FOREIGN
MERCHANT
ANY
DIFFERENT
THAN
THE
SERVANT
WHO
SHAVED
HIM
AND
THE
STREET-VENDOR
WHOM
HE
LET
CHEAT
HIM
OUT
OF
SOME
SMALL
CHANGE
WHEN
BUYING
BANANAS.
WHEN
KAMASWAMI
CAME
TO
HIM,
TO
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
HIS
WORRIES
OR
TO
REPROACH
HIM
CONCERNING
HIS
BUSINESS,
HE
LISTENED
CURIOUSLY
AND
HAPPILY,
WAS
PUZZLED
BY
HIM,
TRIED
TO
UNDERSTAND
HIM,
CONSENTED
THAT
HE
WAS
A
LITTLE
BIT
RIGHT,
ONLY
AS
MUCH
AS
HE
CONSIDERED
INDISPENSABLE,
AND
TURNED
AWAY
FROM
HIM,
TOWARDS
THE
NEXT
PERSON
WHO
WOULD
ASK
FOR
HIM.
AND
THERE
WERE
MANY
WHO
CAME
TO
HIM,
MANY
TO
DO
BUSINESS
WITH
HIM,
MANY
TO
CHEAT
HIM,
MANY
TO
DRAW
SOME
SECRET
OUT
OF
HIM,
MANY
TO
APPEAL
TO
HIS
SYMPATHY,
MANY
TO
GET
HIS
ADVICE.
HE
GAVE
ADVICE,
HE
PITIED,
HE
MADE
GIFTS,
HE
LET
THEM
CHEAT
HIM
A
BIT,
AND
THIS
ENTIRE
GAME
AND
THE
PASSION
WITH
WHICH
ALL
PEOPLE
PLAYED
THIS
GAME
OCCUPIED
HIS
THOUGHTS
JUST
AS
MUCH
AS
THE
GODS
AND
BRAHMANS
USED
TO
OCCUPY
THEM.
AT
TIMES
HE
FELT,
DEEP
IN
HIS
CHEST,
A
DYING,
QUIET
VOICE,
WHICH
ADMONISHED
HIM
QUIETLY,
LAMENTED
QUIETLY;
HE
HARDLY
PERCEIVED
IT.
AND
THEN,
FOR
AN
HOUR,
HE
BECAME
AWARE
OF
THE
STRANGE
LIFE
HE
WAS
LEADING,
OF
HIM
DOING
LOTS
OF
THINGS
WHICH
WERE
ONLY
A
GAME,
OF,
THOUGH
BEING
HAPPY
AND
FEELING
JOY
AT
TIMES,
REAL
LIFE
STILL
PASSING
HIM
BY
AND
NOT
TOUCHING
HIM.
AS
A
BALL-PLAYER
PLAYS
WITH
HIS
BALLS,
HE
PLAYED
WITH
HIS
BUSINESS-DEALS,
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
AROUND
HIM,
WATCHED
THEM,
FOUND
AMUSEMENT
IN
THEM;
WITH
HIS
HEART,
WITH
THE
SOURCE
OF
HIS
BEING,
HE
WAS
NOT
WITH
THEM.
THE
SOURCE
RAN
SOMEWHERE,
FAR
AWAY
FROM
HIM,
RAN
AND
RAN
INVISIBLY,
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
HIS
LIFE
ANY
MORE.
AND
AT
SEVERAL
TIMES
HE
SUDDENLY
BECAME
SCARED
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
SUCH
THOUGHTS
AND
WISHED
THAT
HE
WOULD
ALSO
BE
GIFTED
WITH
THE
ABILITY
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
ALL
OF
THIS
CHILDLIKE-NAIVE
OCCUPATIONS
OF
THE
DAYTIME
WITH
PASSION
AND
WITH
HIS
HEART,
REALLY
TO
LIVE,
REALLY
TO
ACT,
REALLY
TO
ENJOY
AND
TO
LIVE
INSTEAD
OF
JUST
STANDING
BY
AS
A
SPECTATOR.
BUT
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN,
HE
CAME
BACK
TO
BEAUTIFUL
KAMALA,
LEARNED
THE
ART
OF
LOVE,
PRACTISED
THE
CULT
OF
LUST,
IN
WHICH
MORE
THAN
IN
ANYTHING
ELSE
GIVING
AND
TAKING
BECOMES
ONE,
CHATTED
WITH
HER,
LEARNED
FROM
HER,
GAVE
HER
ADVICE,
RECEIVED
ADVICE.
SHE
UNDERSTOOD
HIM
BETTER
THAN
GOVINDA
USED
TO
UNDERSTAND
HIM,
SHE
WAS
MORE
SIMILAR
TO
HIM.
ONCE,
HE
SAID
TO
HER:
"YOU
ARE
LIKE
ME,
YOU
ARE
DIFFERENT
FROM
MOST
PEOPLE.
YOU
ARE
KAMALA,
NOTHING
ELSE,
AND
INSIDE
OF
YOU,
THERE
IS
A
PEACE
AND
REFUGE,
TO
WHICH
YOU
CAN
GO
AT
EVERY
HOUR
OF
THE
DAY
AND
BE
AT
HOME
AT
YOURSELF,
AS
I
CAN
ALSO
DO.
FEW
PEOPLE
HAVE
THIS,
AND
YET
ALL
COULD
HAVE
IT."
"NOT
ALL
PEOPLE
ARE
SMART,"
SAID
KAMALA.
"NO,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA,
"THAT'S
NOT
THE
REASON
WHY.
KAMASWAMI
IS
JUST
AS
SMART
AS
I,
AND
STILL
HAS
NO
REFUGE
IN
HIMSELF.
OTHERS
HAVE
IT,
WHO
ARE
SMALL
CHILDREN
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THEIR
MIND.
MOST
PEOPLE,
KAMALA,
ARE
LIKE
A
FALLING
LEAF,
WHICH
IS
BLOWN
AND
IS
TURNING
AROUND
THROUGH
THE
AIR,
AND
WAVERS,
AND
TUMBLES
TO
THE
GROUND.
BUT
OTHERS,
A
FEW,
ARE
LIKE
STARS,
THEY
GO
ON
A
FIXED
COURSE,
NO
WIND
REACHES
THEM,
IN
THEMSELVES
THEY
HAVE
THEIR
LAW
AND
THEIR
COURSE.
AMONG
ALL
THE
LEARNED
MEN
AND
SAMANAS,
OF
WHICH
I
KNEW
MANY,
THERE
WAS
ONE
OF
THIS
KIND,
A
PERFECTED
ONE,
I'LL
NEVER
BE
ABLE
TO
FORGET
HIM.
IT
IS
THAT
GOTAMA,
THE
EXALTED
ONE,
WHO
IS
SPREADING
THAT
TEACHINGS.
THOUSANDS
OF
FOLLOWERS
ARE
LISTENING
TO
HIS
TEACHINGS
EVERY
DAY,
FOLLOW
HIS
INSTRUCTIONS
EVERY
HOUR,
BUT
THEY
ARE
ALL
FALLING
LEAVES,
NOT
IN
THEMSELVES
THEY
HAVE
TEACHINGS
AND
A
LAW."
KAMALA
LOOKED
AT
HIM
WITH
A
SMILE.
"AGAIN,
YOU'RE
TALKING
ABOUT
HIM,"
SHE
SAID,
"AGAIN,
YOU'RE
HAVING
A
SAMANA'S
THOUGHTS."
SIDDHARTHA
SAID
NOTHING,
AND
THEY
PLAYED
THE
GAME
OF
LOVE,
ONE
OF
THE
THIRTY
OR
FORTY
DIFFERENT
GAMES
KAMALA
KNEW.
HER
BODY
WAS
FLEXIBLE
LIKE
THAT
OF
A
JAGUAR
AND
LIKE
THE
BOW
OF
A
HUNTER;
HE
WHO
HAD
LEARNED
FROM
HER
HOW
TO
MAKE
LOVE,
WAS
KNOWLEDGEABLE
OF
MANY
FORMS
OF
LUST,
MANY
SECRETS.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
SHE
PLAYED
WITH
SIDDHARTHA,
ENTICED
HIM,
REJECTED
HIM,
FORCED
HIM,
EMBRACED
HIM:
ENJOYED
HIS
MASTERFUL
SKILLS,
UNTIL
HE
WAS
DEFEATED
AND
RESTED
EXHAUSTED
BY
HER
SIDE.
THE
COURTESAN
BENT
OVER
HIM,
TOOK
A
LONG
LOOK
AT
HIS
FACE,
AT
HIS
EYES,
WHICH
HAD
GROWN
TIRED.
"YOU
ARE
THE
BEST
LOVER,"
SHE
SAID
THOUGHTFULLY,
"I
EVER
SAW.
YOU'RE
STRONGER
THAN
OTHERS,
MORE
SUPPLE,
MORE
WILLING.
YOU'VE
LEARNED
MY
ART
WELL,
SIDDHARTHA.
AT
SOME
TIME,
WHEN
I'LL
BE
OLDER,
I'D
WANT
TO
BEAR
YOUR
CHILD.
AND
YET,
MY
DEAR,
YOU'VE
REMAINED
A
SAMANA,
AND
YET
YOU
DO
NOT
LOVE
ME,
YOU
LOVE
NOBODY.
ISN'T
IT
SO?"
"IT
MIGHT
VERY
WELL
BE
SO,"
SIDDHARTHA
SAID
TIREDLY.
"I
AM
LIKE
YOU.
YOU
ALSO
DO
NOT
LOVE--HOW
ELSE
COULD
YOU
PRACTISE
LOVE
AS
A
CRAFT?
PERHAPS,
PEOPLE
OF
OUR
KIND
CAN'T
LOVE.
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE
CAN;
THAT'S
THEIR
SECRET."
SANSARA
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
LIVED
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
OF
LUST,
THOUGH
WITHOUT
BEING
A
PART
OF
IT.
HIS
SENSES,
WHICH
HE
HAD
KILLED
OFF
IN
HOT
YEARS
AS
A
SAMANA,
HAD
AWOKEN
AGAIN,
HE
HAD
TASTED
RICHES,
HAD
TASTED
LUST,
HAD
TASTED
POWER;
NEVERTHELESS
HE
HAD
STILL
REMAINED
IN
HIS
HEART
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
A
SAMANA;
KAMALA,
BEING
SMART,
HAD
REALIZED
THIS
QUITE
RIGHT.
IT
WAS
STILL
THE
ART
OF
THINKING,
OF
WAITING,
OF
FASTING,
WHICH
GUIDED
HIS
LIFE;
STILL
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
WORLD,
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE,
HAD
REMAINED
ALIEN
TO
HIM
AS
HE
WAS
ALIEN
TO
THEM.
YEARS
PASSED
BY;
SURROUNDED
BY
THE
GOOD
LIFE,
SIDDHARTHA
HARDLY
FELT
THEM
FADING
AWAY.
HE
HAD
BECOME
RICH,
FOR
QUITE
A
WHILE
HE
POSSESSED
A
HOUSE
OF
HIS
OWN
AND
HIS
OWN
SERVANTS,
AND
A
GARDEN
BEFORE
THE
CITY
BY
THE
RIVER.
THE
PEOPLE
LIKED
HIM,
THEY
CAME
TO
HIM,
WHENEVER
THEY
NEEDED
MONEY
OR
ADVICE,
BUT
THERE
WAS
NOBODY
CLOSE
TO
HIM,
EXCEPT
KAMALA.
THAT
HIGH,
BRIGHT
STATE
OF
BEING
AWAKE,
WHICH
HE
HAD
EXPERIENCED
THAT
ONE
TIME
AT
THE
HEIGHT
OF
HIS
YOUTH,
IN
THOSE
DAYS
AFTER
GOTAMA'S
SERMON,
AFTER
THE
SEPARATION
FROM
GOVINDA,
THAT
TENSE
EXPECTATION,
THAT
PROUD
STATE
OF
STANDING
ALONE
WITHOUT
TEACHINGS
AND
WITHOUT
TEACHERS,
THAT
SUPPLE
WILLINGNESS
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
DIVINE
VOICE
IN
HIS
OWN
HEART,
HAD
SLOWLY
BECOME
A
MEMORY,
HAD
BEEN
FLEETING;
DISTANT
AND
QUIET,
THE
HOLY
SOURCE
MURMURED,
WHICH
USED
TO
BE
NEAR,
WHICH
USED
TO
MURMUR
WITHIN
HIMSELF.
NEVERTHELESS,
MANY
THINGS
HE
HAD
LEARNED
FROM
THE
SAMANAS,
HE
HAD
LEARNED
FROM
GOTAMA,
HE
HAD
LEARNED
FROM
HIS
FATHER
THE
BRAHMAN,
HAD
REMAINED
WITHIN
HIM
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
AFTERWARDS:
MODERATE
LIVING,
JOY
OF
THINKING,
HOURS
OF
MEDITATION,
SECRET
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
SELF,
OF
HIS
ETERNAL
ENTITY,
WHICH
IS
NEITHER
BODY
NOR
CONSCIOUSNESS.
MANY
A
PART
OF
THIS
HE
STILL
HAD,
BUT
ONE
PART
AFTER
ANOTHER
HAD
BEEN
SUBMERGED
AND
HAD
GATHERED
DUST.
JUST
AS
A
POTTER'S
WHEEL,
ONCE
IT
HAS
BEEN
SET
IN
MOTION,
WILL
KEEP
ON
TURNING
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
AND
ONLY
SLOWLY
LOSE
ITS
VIGOUR
AND
COME
TO
A
STOP,
THUS
SIDDHARTHA'S
SOUL
HAD
KEPT
ON
TURNING
THE
WHEEL
OF
ASCETICISM,
THE
WHEEL
OF
THINKING,
THE
WHEEL
OF
DIFFERENTIATION
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
STILL
TURNING,
BUT
IT
TURNED
SLOWLY
AND
HESITANTLY
AND
WAS
CLOSE
TO
COMING
TO
A
STANDSTILL.
SLOWLY,
LIKE
HUMIDITY
ENTERING
THE
DYING
STEM
OF
A
TREE,
FILLING
IT
SLOWLY
AND
MAKING
IT
ROT,
THE
WORLD
AND
SLOTH
HAD
ENTERED
SIDDHARTHA'S
SOUL,
SLOWLY
IT
FILLED
HIS
SOUL,
MADE
IT
HEAVY,
MADE
IT
TIRED,
PUT
IT
TO
SLEEP.
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND,
HIS
SENSES
HAD
BECOME
ALIVE,
THERE
WAS
MUCH
THEY
HAD
LEARNED,
MUCH
THEY
HAD
EXPERIENCED.
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
LEARNED
TO
TRADE,
TO
USE
HIS
POWER
OVER
PEOPLE,
TO
ENJOY
HIMSELF
WITH
A
WOMAN,
HE
HAD
LEARNED
TO
WEAR
BEAUTIFUL
CLOTHES,
TO
GIVE
ORDERS
TO
SERVANTS,
TO
BATHE
IN
PERFUMED
WATERS.
HE
HAD
LEARNED
TO
EAT
TENDERLY
AND
CAREFULLY
PREPARED
FOOD,
EVEN
FISH,
EVEN
MEAT
AND
POULTRY,
SPICES
AND
SWEETS,
AND
TO
DRINK
WINE,
WHICH
CAUSES
SLOTH
AND
FORGETFULNESS.
HE
HAD
LEARNED
TO
PLAY
WITH
DICE
AND
ON
A
CHESS-BOARD,
TO
WATCH
DANCING
GIRLS,
TO
HAVE
HIMSELF
CARRIED
ABOUT
IN
A
SEDAN-CHAIR,
TO
SLEEP
ON
A
SOFT
BED.
BUT
STILL
HE
HAD
FELT
DIFFERENT
FROM
AND
SUPERIOR
TO
THE
OTHERS;
ALWAYS
HE
HAD
WATCHED
THEM
WITH
SOME
MOCKERY,
SOME
MOCKING
DISDAIN,
WITH
THE
SAME
DISDAIN
WHICH
A
SAMANA
CONSTANTLY
FEELS
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
WORLD.
WHEN
KAMASWAMI
WAS
AILING,
WHEN
HE
WAS
ANNOYED,
WHEN
HE
FELT
INSULTED,
WHEN
HE
WAS
VEXED
BY
HIS
WORRIES
AS
A
MERCHANT,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
ALWAYS
WATCHED
IT
WITH
MOCKERY.
JUST
SLOWLY
AND
IMPERCEPTIBLY,
AS
THE
HARVEST
SEASONS
AND
RAINY
SEASONS
PASSED
BY,
HIS
MOCKERY
HAD
BECOME
MORE
TIRED,
HIS
SUPERIORITY
HAD
BECOME
MORE
QUIET.
JUST
SLOWLY,
AMONG
HIS
GROWING
RICHES,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
ASSUMED
SOMETHING
OF
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE'S
WAYS
FOR
HIMSELF,
SOMETHING
OF
THEIR
CHILDLIKENESS
AND
OF
THEIR
FEARFULNESS.
AND
YET,
HE
ENVIED
THEM,
ENVIED
THEM
JUST
THE
MORE,
THE
MORE
SIMILAR
HE
BECAME
TO
THEM.
HE
ENVIED
THEM
FOR
THE
ONE
THING
THAT
WAS
MISSING
FROM
HIM
AND
THAT
THEY
HAD,
THE
IMPORTANCE
THEY
WERE
ABLE
TO
ATTACH
TO
THEIR
LIVES,
THE
AMOUNT
OF
PASSION
IN
THEIR
JOYS
AND
FEARS,
THE
FEARFUL
BUT
SWEET
HAPPINESS
OF
BEING
CONSTANTLY
IN
LOVE.
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
ALL
OF
THE
TIME
IN
LOVE
WITH
THEMSELVES,
WITH
WOMEN,
WITH
THEIR
CHILDREN,
WITH
HONOURS
OR
MONEY,
WITH
PLANS
OR
HOPES.
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
LEARN
THIS
FROM
THEM,
THIS
OUT
OF
ALL
THINGS,
THIS
JOY
OF
A
CHILD
AND
THIS
FOOLISHNESS
OF
A
CHILD;
HE
LEARNED
FROM
THEM
OUT
OF
ALL
THINGS
THE
UNPLEASANT
ONES,
WHICH
HE
HIMSELF
DESPISED.
IT
HAPPENED
MORE
AND
MORE
OFTEN
THAT,
IN
THE
MORNING
AFTER
HAVING
HAD
COMPANY
THE
NIGHT
BEFORE,
HE
STAYED
IN
BED
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
FELT
UNABLE
TO
THINK
AND
TIRED.
IT
HAPPENED
THAT
HE
BECAME
ANGRY
AND
IMPATIENT,
WHEN
KAMASWAMI
BORED
HIM
WITH
HIS
WORRIES.
IT
HAPPENED
THAT
HE
LAUGHED
JUST
TOO
LOUD,
WHEN
HE
LOST
A
GAME
OF
DICE.
HIS
FACE
WAS
STILL
SMARTER
AND
MORE
SPIRITUAL
THAN
OTHERS,
BUT
IT
RARELY
LAUGHED,
AND
ASSUMED,
ONE
AFTER
ANOTHER,
THOSE
FEATURES
WHICH
ARE
SO
OFTEN
FOUND
IN
THE
FACES
OF
RICH
PEOPLE,
THOSE
FEATURES
OF
DISCONTENT,
OF
SICKLINESS,
OF
ILL-HUMOUR,
OF
SLOTH,
OF
A
LACK
OF
LOVE.
SLOWLY
THE
DISEASE
OF
THE
SOUL,
WHICH
RICH
PEOPLE
HAVE,
GRABBED
HOLD
OF
HIM.
LIKE
A
VEIL,
LIKE
A
THIN
MIST,
TIREDNESS
CAME
OVER
SIDDHARTHA,
SLOWLY,
GETTING
A
BIT
DENSER
EVERY
DAY,
A
BIT
MURKIER
EVERY
MONTH,
A
BIT
HEAVIER
EVERY
YEAR.
AS
A
NEW
DRESS
BECOMES
OLD
IN
TIME,
LOSES
ITS
BEAUTIFUL
COLOUR
IN
TIME,
GETS
STAINS,
GETS
WRINKLES,
GETS
WORN
OFF
AT
THE
SEAMS,
AND
STARTS
TO
SHOW
THREADBARE
SPOTS
HERE
AND
THERE,
THUS
SIDDHARTHA'S
NEW
LIFE,
WHICH
HE
HAD
STARTED
AFTER
HIS
SEPARATION
FROM
GOVINDA,
HAD
GROWN
OLD,
LOST
COLOUR
AND
SPLENDOUR
AS
THE
YEARS
PASSED
BY,
WAS
GATHERING
WRINKLES
AND
STAINS,
AND
HIDDEN
AT
BOTTOM,
ALREADY
SHOWING
ITS
UGLINESS
HERE
AND
THERE,
DISAPPOINTMENT
AND
DISGUST
WERE
WAITING.
SIDDHARTHA
DID
NOT
NOTICE
IT.
HE
ONLY
NOTICED
THAT
THIS
BRIGHT
AND
RELIABLE
VOICE
INSIDE
OF
HIM,
WHICH
HAD
AWOKEN
IN
HIM
AT
THAT
TIME
AND
HAD
EVER
GUIDED
HIM
IN
HIS
BEST
TIMES,
HAD
BECOME
SILENT.
HE
HAD
BEEN
CAPTURED
BY
THE
WORLD,
BY
LUST,
COVETOUSNESS,
SLOTH,
AND
FINALLY
ALSO
BY
THAT
VICE
WHICH
HE
HAD
USED
TO
DESPISE
AND
MOCK
THE
MOST
AS
THE
MOST
FOOLISH
ONE
OF
ALL
VICES:
GREED.
PROPERTY,
POSSESSIONS,
AND
RICHES
ALSO
HAD
FINALLY
CAPTURED
HIM;
THEY
WERE
NO
LONGER
A
GAME
AND
TRIFLES
TO
HIM,
HAD
BECOME
A
SHACKLE
AND
A
BURDEN.
ON
A
STRANGE
AND
DEVIOUS
WAY,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
GOTTEN
INTO
THIS
FINAL
AND
MOST
BASE
OF
ALL
DEPENDENCIES,
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
GAME
OF
DICE.
IT
WAS
SINCE
THAT
TIME,
WHEN
HE
HAD
STOPPED
BEING
A
SAMANA
IN
HIS
HEART,
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
BEGAN
TO
PLAY
THE
GAME
FOR
MONEY
AND
PRECIOUS
THINGS,
WHICH
HE
AT
OTHER
TIMES
ONLY
JOINED
WITH
A
SMILE
AND
CASUALLY
AS
A
CUSTOM
OF
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE,
WITH
AN
INCREASING
RAGE
AND
PASSION.
HE
WAS
A
FEARED
GAMBLER,
FEW
DARED
TO
TAKE
HIM
ON,
SO
HIGH
AND
AUDACIOUS
WERE
HIS
STAKES.
HE
PLAYED
THE
GAME
DUE
TO
A
PAIN
OF
HIS
HEART,
LOSING
AND
WASTING
HIS
WRETCHED
MONEY
IN
THE
GAME
BROUGHT
HIM
AN
ANGRY
JOY,
IN
NO
OTHER
WAY
HE
COULD
DEMONSTRATE
HIS
DISDAIN
FOR
WEALTH,
THE
MERCHANTS'
FALSE
GOD,
MORE
CLEARLY
AND
MORE
MOCKINGLY.
THUS
HE
GAMBLED
WITH
HIGH
STAKES
AND
MERCILESSLY,
HATING
HIMSELF,
MOCKING
HIMSELF,
WON
THOUSANDS,
THREW
AWAY
THOUSANDS,
LOST
MONEY,
LOST
JEWELRY,
LOST
A
HOUSE
IN
THE
COUNTRY,
WON
AGAIN,
LOST
AGAIN.
THAT
FEAR,
THAT
TERRIBLE
AND
PETRIFYING
FEAR,
WHICH
HE
FELT
WHILE
HE
WAS
ROLLING
THE
DICE,
WHILE
HE
WAS
WORRIED
ABOUT
LOSING
HIGH
STAKES,
THAT
FEAR
HE
LOVED
AND
SOUGHT
TO
ALWAYS
RENEW
IT,
ALWAYS
INCREASE
IT,
ALWAYS
GET
IT
TO
A
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
LEVEL,
FOR
IN
THIS
FEELING
ALONE
HE
STILL
FELT
SOMETHING
LIKE
HAPPINESS,
SOMETHING
LIKE
AN
INTOXICATION,
SOMETHING
LIKE
AN
ELEVATED
FORM
OF
LIFE
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
HIS
SATURATED,
LUKEWARM,
DULL
LIFE.
AND
AFTER
EACH
BIG
LOSS,
HIS
MIND
WAS
SET
ON
NEW
RICHES,
PURSUED
THE
TRADE
MORE
ZEALOUSLY,
FORCED
HIS
DEBTORS
MORE
STRICTLY
TO
PAY,
BECAUSE
HE
WANTED
TO
CONTINUE
GAMBLING,
HE
WANTED
TO
CONTINUE
SQUANDERING,
CONTINUE
DEMONSTRATING
HIS
DISDAIN
OF
WEALTH.
SIDDHARTHA
LOST
HIS
CALMNESS
WHEN
LOSSES
OCCURRED,
LOST
HIS
PATIENCE
WHEN
HE
WAS
NOT
PAYED
ON
TIME,
LOST
HIS
KINDNESS
TOWARDS
BEGGARS,
LOST
HIS
DISPOSITION
FOR
GIVING
AWAY
AND
LOANING
MONEY
TO
THOSE
WHO
PETITIONED
HIM.
HE,
WHO
GAMBLED
AWAY
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
AT
ONE
ROLL
OF
THE
DICE
AND
LAUGHED
AT
IT,
BECAME
MORE
STRICT
AND
MORE
PETTY
IN
HIS
BUSINESS,
OCCASIONALLY
DREAMING
AT
NIGHT
ABOUT
MONEY!
AND
WHENEVER
HE
WOKE
UP
FROM
THIS
UGLY
SPELL,
WHENEVER
HE
FOUND
HIS
FACE
IN
THE
MIRROR
AT
THE
BEDROOM'S
WALL
TO
HAVE
AGED
AND
BECOME
MORE
UGLY,
WHENEVER
EMBARRASSMENT
AND
DISGUST
CAME
OVER
HIM,
HE
CONTINUED
FLEEING,
FLEEING
INTO
A
NEW
GAME,
FLEEING
INTO
A
NUMBING
OF
HIS
MIND
BROUGHT
ON
BY
SEX,
BY
WINE,
AND
FROM
THERE
HE
FLED
BACK
INTO
THE
URGE
TO
PILE
UP
AND
OBTAIN
POSSESSIONS.
IN
THIS
POINTLESS
CYCLE
HE
RAN,
GROWING
TIRED,
GROWING
OLD,
GROWING
ILL.
THEN
THE
TIME
CAME
WHEN
A
DREAM
WARNED
HIM.
HE
HAD
SPEND
THE
HOURS
OF
THE
EVENING
WITH
KAMALA,
IN
HER
BEAUTIFUL
PLEASURE-GARDEN.
THEY
HAD
BEEN
SITTING
UNDER
THE
TREES,
TALKING,
AND
KAMALA
HAD
SAID
THOUGHTFUL
WORDS,
WORDS
BEHIND
WHICH
A
SADNESS
AND
TIREDNESS
LAY
HIDDEN.
SHE
HAD
ASKED
HIM
TO
TELL
HER
ABOUT
GOTAMA,
AND
COULD
NOT
HEAR
ENOUGH
OF
HIM,
HOW
CLEAR
HIS
EYES,
HOW
STILL
AND
BEAUTIFUL
HIS
MOUTH,
HOW
KIND
HIS
SMILE,
HOW
PEACEFUL
HIS
WALK
HAD
BEEN.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
HAD
TO
TELL
HER
ABOUT
THE
EXALTED
BUDDHA,
AND
KAMALA
HAD
SIGHED
AND
HAD
SAID:
"ONE
DAY,
PERHAPS
SOON,
I'LL
ALSO
FOLLOW
THAT
BUDDHA.
I'LL
GIVE
HIM
MY
PLEASURE-GARDEN
FOR
A
GIFT
AND
TAKE
MY
REFUGE
IN
HIS
TEACHINGS."
BUT
AFTER
THIS,
SHE
HAD
AROUSED
HIM,
AND
HAD
TIED
HIM
TO
HER
IN
THE
ACT
OF
MAKING
LOVE
WITH
PAINFUL
FERVOUR,
BITING
AND
IN
TEARS,
AS
IF,
ONCE
MORE,
SHE
WANTED
TO
SQUEEZE
THE
LAST
SWEET
DROP
OUT
OF
THIS
VAIN,
FLEETING
PLEASURE.
NEVER
BEFORE,
IT
HAD
BECOME
SO
STRANGELY
CLEAR
TO
SIDDHARTHA,
HOW
CLOSELY
LUST
WAS
AKIN
TO
DEATH.
THEN
HE
HAD
LAIN
BY
HER
SIDE,
AND
KAMALA'S
FACE
HAD
BEEN
CLOSE
TO
HIM,
AND
UNDER
HER
EYES
AND
NEXT
TO
THE
CORNERS
OF
HER
MOUTH
HE
HAD,
AS
CLEARLY
AS
NEVER
BEFORE,
READ
A
FEARFUL
INSCRIPTION,
AN
INSCRIPTION
OF
SMALL
LINES,
OF
SLIGHT
GROOVES,
AN
INSCRIPTION
REMINISCENT
OF
AUTUMN
AND
OLD
AGE,
JUST
AS
SIDDHARTHA
HIMSELF,
WHO
WAS
ONLY
IN
HIS
FORTIES,
HAD
ALREADY
NOTICED,
HERE
AND
THERE,
GRAY
HAIRS
AMONG
HIS
BLACK
ONES.
TIREDNESS
WAS
WRITTEN
ON
KAMALA'S
BEAUTIFUL
FACE,
TIREDNESS
FROM
WALKING
A
LONG
PATH,
WHICH
HAS
NO
HAPPY
DESTINATION,
TIREDNESS
AND
THE
BEGINNING
OF
WITHERING,
AND
CONCEALED,
STILL
UNSAID,
PERHAPS
NOT
EVEN
CONSCIOUS
ANXIETY:
FEAR
OF
OLD
AGE,
FEAR
OF
THE
AUTUMN,
FEAR
OF
HAVING
TO
DIE.
WITH
A
SIGH,
HE
HAD
BID
HIS
FAREWELL
TO
HER,
THE
SOUL
FULL
OF
RELUCTANCE,
AND
FULL
OF
CONCEALED
ANXIETY.
THEN,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
SPENT
THE
NIGHT
IN
HIS
HOUSE
WITH
DANCING
GIRLS
AND
WINE,
HAD
ACTED
AS
IF
HE
WAS
SUPERIOR
TO
THEM
TOWARDS
THE
FELLOW-MEMBERS
OF
HIS
CASTE,
THOUGH
THIS
WAS
NO
LONGER
TRUE,
HAD
DRUNK
MUCH
WINE
AND
GONE
TO
BED
A
LONG
TIME
AFTER
MIDNIGHT,
BEING
TIRED
AND
YET
EXCITED,
CLOSE
TO
WEEPING
AND
DESPAIR,
AND
HAD
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
SOUGHT
TO
SLEEP
IN
VAIN,
HIS
HEART
FULL
OF
MISERY
WHICH
HE
THOUGHT
HE
COULD
NOT
BEAR
ANY
LONGER,
FULL
OF
A
DISGUST
WHICH
HE
FELT
PENETRATING
HIS
ENTIRE
BODY
LIKE
THE
LUKEWARM,
REPULSIVE
TASTE
OF
THE
WINE,
THE
JUST
TOO
SWEET,
DULL
MUSIC,
THE
JUST
TOO
SOFT
SMILE
OF
THE
DANCING
GIRLS,
THE
JUST
TOO
SWEET
SCENT
OF
THEIR
HAIR
AND
BREASTS.
BUT
MORE
THAN
BY
ANYTHING
ELSE,
HE
WAS
DISGUSTED
BY
HIMSELF,
BY
HIS
PERFUMED
HAIR,
BY
THE
SMELL
OF
WINE
FROM
HIS
MOUTH,
BY
THE
FLABBY
TIREDNESS
AND
LISTLESSNESS
OF
HIS
SKIN.
LIKE
WHEN
SOMEONE,
WHO
HAS
EATEN
AND
DRUNK
FAR
TOO
MUCH,
VOMITS
IT
BACK
UP
AGAIN
WITH
AGONISING
PAIN
AND
IS
NEVERTHELESS
GLAD
ABOUT
THE
RELIEF,
THUS
THIS
SLEEPLESS
MAN
WISHED
TO
FREE
HIMSELF
OF
THESE
PLEASURES,
THESE
HABITS
AND
ALL
OF
THIS
POINTLESS
LIFE
AND
HIMSELF,
IN
AN
IMMENSE
BURST
OF
DISGUST.
NOT
UNTIL
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
MORNING
AND
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
FIRST
ACTIVITIES
IN
THE
STREET
BEFORE
HIS
CITY-HOUSE,
HE
HAD
SLIGHTLY
FALLEN
ASLEEP,
HAD
FOUND
FOR
A
FEW
MOMENTS
A
HALF
UNCONSCIOUSNESS,
A
HINT
OF
SLEEP.
IN
THOSE
MOMENTS,
HE
HAD
A
DREAM:
KAMALA
OWNED
A
SMALL,
RARE
SINGING
BIRD
IN
A
GOLDEN
CAGE.
OF
THIS
BIRD,
HE
DREAMT.
HE
DREAMT:
THIS
BIRD
HAD
BECOME
MUTE,
WHO
AT
OTHER
TIMES
ALWAYS
USED
TO
SING
IN
THE
MORNING,
AND
SINCE
THIS
AROSE
HIS
ATTENTION,
HE
STEPPED
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
CAGE
AND
LOOKED
INSIDE;
THERE
THE
SMALL
BIRD
WAS
DEAD
AND
LAY
STIFF
ON
THE
GROUND.
HE
TOOK
IT
OUT,
WEIGHED
IT
FOR
A
MOMENT
IN
HIS
HAND,
AND
THEN
THREW
IT
AWAY,
OUT
IN
THE
STREET,
AND
IN
THE
SAME
MOMENT,
HE
FELT
TERRIBLY
SHOCKED,
AND
HIS
HEART
HURT,
AS
IF
HE
HAD
THROWN
AWAY
FROM
HIMSELF
ALL
VALUE
AND
EVERYTHING
GOOD
BY
THROWING
OUT
THIS
DEAD
BIRD.
STARTING
UP
FROM
THIS
DREAM,
HE
FELT
ENCOMPASSED
BY
A
DEEP
SADNESS.
WORTHLESS,
SO
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM,
WORTHLESS
AND
POINTLESS
WAS
THE
WAY
HE
HAD
BEEN
GOING
THROUGH
LIFE;
NOTHING
WHICH
WAS
ALIVE,
NOTHING
WHICH
WAS
IN
SOME
WAY
DELICIOUS
OR
WORTH
KEEPING
HE
HAD
LEFT
IN
HIS
HANDS.
ALONE
HE
STOOD
THERE
AND
EMPTY
LIKE
A
CASTAWAY
ON
THE
SHORE.
WITH
A
GLOOMY
MIND,
SIDDHARTHA
WENT
TO
THE
PLEASURE-GARDEN
HE
OWNED,
LOCKED
THE
GATE,
SAT
DOWN
UNDER
A
MANGO-TREE,
FELT
DEATH
IN
HIS
HEART
AND
HORROR
IN
HIS
CHEST,
SAT
AND
SENSED
HOW
EVERYTHING
DIED
IN
HIM,
WITHERED
IN
HIM,
CAME
TO
AN
END
IN
HIM.
BY
AND
BY,
HE
GATHERED
HIS
THOUGHTS,
AND
IN
HIS
MIND,
HE
ONCE
AGAIN
WENT
THE
ENTIRE
PATH
OF
HIS
LIFE,
STARTING
WITH
THE
FIRST
DAYS
HE
COULD
REMEMBER.
WHEN
WAS
THERE
EVER
A
TIME
WHEN
HE
HAD
EXPERIENCED
HAPPINESS,
FELT
A
TRUE
BLISS?
OH
YES,
SEVERAL
TIMES
HE
HAD
EXPERIENCED
SUCH
A
THING.
IN
HIS
YEARS
AS
A
BOY,
HE
HAS
HAD
A
TASTE
OF
IT,
WHEN
HE
HAD
OBTAINED
PRAISE
FROM
THE
BRAHMANS,
HE
HAD
FELT
IT
IN
HIS
HEART:
"THERE
IS
A
PATH
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
ONE
WHO
HAS
DISTINGUISHED
HIMSELF
IN
THE
RECITATION
OF
THE
HOLY
VERSES,
IN
THE
DISPUTE
WITH
THE
LEARNED
ONES,
AS
AN
ASSISTANT
IN
THE
OFFERINGS."
THEN,
HE
HAD
FELT
IT
IN
HIS
HEART:
"THERE
IS
A
PATH
IN
FRONT
OF
YOU,
YOU
ARE
DESTINED
FOR,
THE
GODS
ARE
AWAITING
YOU."
AND
AGAIN,
AS
A
YOUNG
MAN,
WHEN
THE
EVER
RISING,
UPWARD
FLEEING,
GOAL
OF
ALL
THINKING
HAD
RIPPED
HIM
OUT
OF
AND
UP
FROM
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
THOSE
SEEKING
THE
SAME
GOAL,
WHEN
HE
WRESTLED
IN
PAIN
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
BRAHMAN,
WHEN
EVERY
OBTAINED
KNOWLEDGE
ONLY
KINDLED
NEW
THIRST
IN
HIM,
THEN
AGAIN
HE
HAD,
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
THIRST,
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
PAIN
FELT
THIS
VERY
SAME
THING:
"GO
ON!
GO
ON!
YOU
ARE
CALLED
UPON!"
HE
HAD
HEARD
THIS
VOICE
WHEN
HE
HAD
LEFT
HIS
HOME
AND
HAD
CHOSEN
THE
LIFE
OF
A
SAMANA,
AND
AGAIN
WHEN
HE
HAD
GONE
AWAY
FROM
THE
SAMANAS
TO
THAT
PERFECTED
ONE,
AND
ALSO
WHEN
HE
HAD
GONE
AWAY
FROM
HIM
TO
THE
UNCERTAIN.
FOR
HOW
LONG
HAD
HE
NOT
HEARD
THIS
VOICE
ANY
MORE,
FOR
HOW
LONG
HAD
HE
REACHED
NO
HEIGHT
ANY
MORE,
HOW
EVEN
AND
DULL
WAS
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
HIS
PATH
HAD
PASSED
THROUGH
LIFE,
FOR
MANY
LONG
YEARS,
WITHOUT
A
HIGH
GOAL,
WITHOUT
THIRST,
WITHOUT
ELEVATION,
CONTENT
WITH
SMALL
LUSTFUL
PLEASURES
AND
YET
NEVER
SATISFIED!
FOR
ALL
OF
THESE
MANY
YEARS,
WITHOUT
KNOWING
IT
HIMSELF,
HE
HAD
TRIED
HARD
AND
LONGED
TO
BECOME
A
MAN
LIKE
THOSE
MANY,
LIKE
THOSE
CHILDREN,
AND
IN
ALL
THIS,
HIS
LIFE
HAD
BEEN
MUCH
MORE
MISERABLE
AND
POORER
THAN
THEIRS,
AND
THEIR
GOALS
WERE
NOT
HIS,
NOR
THEIR
WORRIES;
AFTER
ALL,
THAT
ENTIRE
WORLD
OF
THE
KAMASWAMI-PEOPLE
HAD
ONLY
BEEN
A
GAME
TO
HIM,
A
DANCE
HE
WOULD
WATCH,
A
COMEDY.
ONLY
KAMALA
HAD
BEEN
DEAR,
HAD
BEEN
VALUABLE
TO
HIM--BUT
WAS
SHE
STILL
THUS?
DID
HE
STILL
NEED
HER,
OR
SHE
HIM?
DID
THEY
NOT
PLAY
A
GAME
WITHOUT
AN
ENDING?
WAS
IT
NECESSARY
TO
LIVE
FOR
THIS?
NO,
IT
WAS
NOT
NECESSARY!
THE
NAME
OF
THIS
GAME
WAS
SANSARA,
A
GAME
FOR
CHILDREN,
A
GAME
WHICH
WAS
PERHAPS
ENJOYABLE
TO
PLAY
ONCE,
TWICE,
TEN
TIMES--BUT
FOR
EVER
AND
EVER
OVER
AGAIN?
THEN,
SIDDHARTHA
KNEW
THAT
THE
GAME
WAS
OVER,
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
PLAY
IT
ANY
MORE.
SHIVERS
RAN
OVER
HIS
BODY,
INSIDE
OF
HIM,
SO
HE
FELT,
SOMETHING
HAD
DIED.
THAT
ENTIRE
DAY,
HE
SAT
UNDER
THE
MANGO-TREE,
THINKING
OF
HIS
FATHER,
THINKING
OF
GOVINDA,
THINKING
OF
GOTAMA.
DID
HE
HAVE
TO
LEAVE
THEM
TO
BECOME
A
KAMASWAMI?
HE
STILL
SAT
THERE,
WHEN
THE
NIGHT
HAD
FALLEN.
WHEN,
LOOKING
UP,
HE
CAUGHT
SIGHT
OF
THE
STARS,
HE
THOUGHT:
"HERE
I'M
SITTING
UNDER
MY
MANGO-TREE,
IN
MY
PLEASURE-GARDEN."
HE
SMILED
A
LITTLE
--WAS
IT
REALLY
NECESSARY,
WAS
IT
RIGHT,
WAS
IT
NOT
AS
FOOLISH
GAME,
THAT
HE
OWNED
A
MANGO-TREE,
THAT
HE
OWNED
A
GARDEN?
HE
ALSO
PUT
AN
END
TO
THIS,
THIS
ALSO
DIED
IN
HIM.
HE
ROSE,
BID
HIS
FAREWELL
TO
THE
MANGO-TREE,
HIS
FAREWELL
TO
THE
PLEASURE-GARDEN.
SINCE
HE
HAD
BEEN
WITHOUT
FOOD
THIS
DAY,
HE
FELT
STRONG
HUNGER,
AND
THOUGHT
OF
HIS
HOUSE
IN
THE
CITY,
OF
HIS
CHAMBER
AND
BED,
OF
THE
TABLE
WITH
THE
MEALS
ON
IT.
HE
SMILED
TIREDLY,
SHOOK
HIMSELF,
AND
BID
HIS
FAREWELL
TO
THESE
THINGS.
IN
THE
SAME
HOUR
OF
THE
NIGHT,
SIDDHARTHA
LEFT
HIS
GARDEN,
LEFT
THE
CITY,
AND
NEVER
CAME
BACK.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
KAMASWAMI
HAD
PEOPLE
LOOK
FOR
HIM,
THINKING
THAT
HE
HAD
FALLEN
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
ROBBERS.
KAMALA
HAD
NO
ONE
LOOK
FOR
HIM.
WHEN
SHE
WAS
TOLD
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
DISAPPEARED,
SHE
WAS
NOT
ASTONISHED.
DID
SHE
NOT
ALWAYS
EXPECT
IT?
WAS
HE
NOT
A
SAMANA,
A
MAN
WHO
WAS
AT
HOME
NOWHERE,
A
PILGRIM?
AND
MOST
OF
ALL,
SHE
HAD
FELT
THIS
THE
LAST
TIME
THEY
HAD
BEEN
TOGETHER,
AND
SHE
WAS
HAPPY,
IN
SPITE
OF
ALL
THE
PAIN
OF
THE
LOSS,
THAT
SHE
HAD
PULLED
HIM
SO
AFFECTIONATELY
TO
HER
HEART
FOR
THIS
LAST
TIME,
THAT
SHE
HAD
FELT
ONE
MORE
TIME
TO
BE
SO
COMPLETELY
POSSESSED
AND
PENETRATED
BY
HIM.
WHEN
SHE
RECEIVED
THE
FIRST
NEWS
OF
SIDDHARTHA'S
DISAPPEARANCE,
SHE
WENT
TO
THE
WINDOW,
WHERE
SHE
HELD
A
RARE
SINGING
BIRD
CAPTIVE
IN
A
GOLDEN
CAGE.
SHE
OPENED
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
CAGE,
TOOK
THE
BIRD
OUT
AND
LET
IT
FLY.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
SHE
GAZED
AFTER
IT,
THE
FLYING
BIRD.
FROM
THIS
DAY
ON,
SHE
RECEIVED
NO
MORE
VISITORS
AND
KEPT
HER
HOUSE
LOCKED.
BUT
AFTER
SOME
TIME,
SHE
BECAME
AWARE
THAT
SHE
WAS
PREGNANT
FROM
THE
LAST
TIME
SHE
WAS
TOGETHER
WITH
SIDDHARTHA.
BY
THE
RIVER
SIDDHARTHA
WALKED
THROUGH
THE
FOREST,
WAS
ALREADY
FAR
FROM
THE
CITY,
AND
KNEW
NOTHING
BUT
THAT
ONE
THING,
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
GOING
BACK
FOR
HIM,
THAT
THIS
LIFE,
AS
HE
HAD
LIVED
IT
FOR
MANY
YEARS
UNTIL
NOW,
WAS
OVER
AND
DONE
AWAY
WITH,
AND
THAT
HE
HAD
TASTED
ALL
OF
IT,
SUCKED
EVERYTHING
OUT
OF
IT
UNTIL
HE
WAS
DISGUSTED
WITH
IT.
DEAD
WAS
THE
SINGING
BIRD,
HE
HAD
DREAMT
OF.
DEAD
WAS
THE
BIRD
IN
HIS
HEART.
DEEPLY,
HE
HAD
BEEN
ENTANGLED
IN
SANSARA,
HE
HAD
SUCKED
UP
DISGUST
AND
DEATH
FROM
ALL
SIDES
INTO
HIS
BODY,
LIKE
A
SPONGE
SUCKS
UP
WATER
UNTIL
IT
IS
FULL.
AND
FULL
HE
WAS,
FULL
OF
THE
FEELING
OF
BEEN
SICK
OF
IT,
FULL
OF
MISERY,
FULL
OF
DEATH,
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
LEFT
IN
THIS
WORLD
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
ATTRACTED
HIM,
GIVEN
HIM
JOY,
GIVEN
HIM
COMFORT.
PASSIONATELY
HE
WISHED
TO
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
HIMSELF
ANYMORE,
TO
HAVE
REST,
TO
BE
DEAD.
IF
THERE
ONLY
WAS
A
LIGHTNING-BOLT
TO
STRIKE
HIM
DEAD!
IF
THERE
ONLY
WAS
A
TIGER
A
DEVOUR
HIM!
IF
THERE
ONLY
WAS
A
WINE,
A
POISON
WHICH
WOULD
NUMB
HIS
SENSES,
BRING
HIM
FORGETFULNESS
AND
SLEEP,
AND
NO
AWAKENING
FROM
THAT!
WAS
THERE
STILL
ANY
KIND
OF
FILTH,
HE
HAD
NOT
SOILED
HIMSELF
WITH,
A
SIN
OR
FOOLISH
ACT
HE
HAD
NOT
COMMITTED,
A
DREARINESS
OF
THE
SOUL
HE
HAD
NOT
BROUGHT
UPON
HIMSELF?
WAS
IT
STILL
AT
ALL
POSSIBLE
TO
BE
ALIVE?
WAS
IT
POSSIBLE,
TO
BREATHE
IN
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN,
TO
BREATHE
OUT,
TO
FEEL
HUNGER,
TO
EAT
AGAIN,
TO
SLEEP
AGAIN,
TO
SLEEP
WITH
A
WOMAN
AGAIN?
WAS
THIS
CYCLE
NOT
EXHAUSTED
AND
BROUGHT
TO
A
CONCLUSION
FOR
HIM?
SIDDHARTHA
REACHED
THE
LARGE
RIVER
IN
THE
FOREST,
THE
SAME
RIVER
OVER
WHICH
A
LONG
TIME
AGO,
WHEN
HE
HAD
STILL
BEEN
A
YOUNG
MAN
AND
CAME
FROM
THE
TOWN
OF
GOTAMA,
A
FERRYMAN
HAD
CONDUCTED
HIM.
BY
THIS
RIVER
HE
STOPPED,
HESITANTLY
HE
STOOD
AT
THE
BANK.
TIREDNESS
AND
HUNGER
HAD
WEAKENED
HIM,
AND
WHATEVER
FOR
SHOULD
HE
WALK
ON,
WHEREVER
TO,
TO
WHICH
GOAL?
NO,
THERE
WERE
NO
MORE
GOALS,
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
LEFT
BUT
THE
DEEP,
PAINFUL
YEARNING
TO
SHAKE
OFF
THIS
WHOLE
DESOLATE
DREAM,
TO
SPIT
OUT
THIS
STALE
WINE,
TO
PUT
AN
END
TO
THIS
MISERABLE
AND
SHAMEFUL
LIFE.
A
HANG
BENT
OVER
THE
BANK
OF
THE
RIVER,
A
COCONUT-TREE;
SIDDHARTHA
LEANED
AGAINST
ITS
TRUNK
WITH
HIS
SHOULDER,
EMBRACED
THE
TRUNK
WITH
ONE
ARM,
AND
LOOKED
DOWN
INTO
THE
GREEN
WATER,
WHICH
RAN
AND
RAN
UNDER
HIM,
LOOKED
DOWN
AND
FOUND
HIMSELF
TO
BE
ENTIRELY
FILLED
WITH
THE
WISH
TO
LET
GO
AND
TO
DROWN
IN
THESE
WATERS.
A
FRIGHTENING
EMPTINESS
WAS
REFLECTED
BACK
AT
HIM
BY
THE
WATER,
ANSWERING
TO
THE
TERRIBLE
EMPTINESS
IN
HIS
SOUL.
YES,
HE
HAD
REACHED
THE
END.
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
LEFT
FOR
HIM,
EXCEPT
TO
ANNIHILATE
HIMSELF,
EXCEPT
TO
SMASH
THE
FAILURE
INTO
WHICH
HE
HAD
SHAPED
HIS
LIFE,
TO
THROW
IT
AWAY,
BEFORE
THE
FEET
OF
MOCKINGLY
LAUGHING
GODS.
THIS
WAS
THE
GREAT
VOMITING
HE
HAD
LONGED
FOR:
DEATH,
THE
SMASHING
TO
BITS
OF
THE
FORM
HE
HATED!
LET
HIM
BE
FOOD
FOR
FISHES,
THIS
DOG
SIDDHARTHA,
THIS
LUNATIC,
THIS
DEPRAVED
AND
ROTTEN
BODY,
THIS
WEAKENED
AND
ABUSED
SOUL!
LET
HIM
BE
FOOD
FOR
FISHES
AND
CROCODILES,
LET
HIM
BE
CHOPPED
TO
BITS
BY
THE
DAEMONS!
WITH
A
DISTORTED
FACE,
HE
STARED
INTO
THE
WATER,
SAW
THE
REFLECTION
OF
HIS
FACE
AND
SPIT
AT
IT.
IN
DEEP
TIREDNESS,
HE
TOOK
HIS
ARM
AWAY
FROM
THE
TRUNK
OF
THE
TREE
AND
TURNED
A
BIT,
IN
ORDER
TO
LET
HIMSELF
FALL
STRAIGHT
DOWN,
IN
ORDER
TO
FINALLY
DROWN.
WITH
HIS
EYES
CLOSED,
HE
SLIPPED
TOWARDS
DEATH.
THEN,
OUT
OF
REMOTE
AREAS
OF
HIS
SOUL,
OUT
OF
PAST
TIMES
OF
HIS
NOW
WEARY
LIFE,
A
SOUND
STIRRED
UP.
IT
WAS
A
WORD,
A
SYLLABLE,
WHICH
HE,
WITHOUT
THINKING,
WITH
A
SLURRED
VOICE,
SPOKE
TO
HIMSELF,
THE
OLD
WORD
WHICH
IS
THE
BEGINNING
AND
THE
END
OF
ALL
PRAYERS
OF
THE
BRAHMANS,
THE
HOLY
"OM",
WHICH
ROUGHLY
MEANS
"THAT
WHAT
IS
PERFECT"
OR
"THE
COMPLETION".
AND
IN
THE
MOMENT
WHEN
THE
SOUND
OF
"OM"
TOUCHED
SIDDHARTHA'S
EAR,
HIS
DORMANT
SPIRIT
SUDDENLY
WOKE
UP
AND
REALIZED
THE
FOOLISHNESS
OF
HIS
ACTIONS.
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
DEEPLY
SHOCKED.
SO
THIS
WAS
HOW
THINGS
WERE
WITH
HIM,
SO
DOOMED
WAS
HE,
SO
MUCH
HE
HAD
LOST
HIS
WAY
AND
WAS
FORSAKEN
BY
ALL
KNOWLEDGE,
THAT
HE
HAD
BEEN
ABLE
TO
SEEK
DEATH,
THAT
THIS
WISH,
THIS
WISH
OF
A
CHILD,
HAD
BEEN
ABLE
TO
GROW
IN
HIM:
TO
FIND
REST
BY
ANNIHILATING
HIS
BODY!
WHAT
ALL
AGONY
OF
THESE
RECENT
TIMES,
ALL
SOBERING
REALIZATIONS,
ALL
DESPERATION
HAD
NOT
BROUGHT
ABOUT,
THIS
WAS
BROUGHT
ON
BY
THIS
MOMENT,
WHEN
THE
OM
ENTERED
HIS
CONSCIOUSNESS:
HE
BECAME
AWARE
OF
HIMSELF
IN
HIS
MISERY
AND
IN
HIS
ERROR.
OM!
HE
SPOKE
TO
HIMSELF:
OM!
AND
AGAIN
HE
KNEW
ABOUT
BRAHMAN,
KNEW
ABOUT
THE
INDESTRUCTIBILITY
OF
LIFE,
KNEW
ABOUT
ALL
THAT
IS
DIVINE,
WHICH
HE
HAD
FORGOTTEN.
BUT
THIS
WAS
ONLY
A
MOMENT,
FLASH.
BY
THE
FOOT
OF
THE
COCONUT-TREE,
SIDDHARTHA
COLLAPSED,
STRUCK
DOWN
BY
TIREDNESS,
MUMBLING
OM,
PLACED
HIS
HEAD
ON
THE
ROOT
OF
THE
TREE
AND
FELL
INTO
A
DEEP
SLEEP.
DEEP
WAS
HIS
SLEEP
AND
WITHOUT
DREAMS,
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
HE
HAD
NOT
KNOWN
SUCH
A
SLEEP
ANY
MORE.
WHEN
HE
WOKE
UP
AFTER
MANY
HOURS,
HE
FELT
AS
IF
TEN
YEARS
HAD
PASSED,
HE
HEARD
THE
WATER
QUIETLY
FLOWING,
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHERE
HE
WAS
AND
WHO
HAD
BROUGHT
HIM
HERE,
OPENED
HIS
EYES,
SAW
WITH
ASTONISHMENT
THAT
THERE
WERE
TREES
AND
THE
SKY
ABOVE
HIM,
AND
HE
REMEMBERED
WHERE
HE
WAS
AND
HOW
HE
GOT
HERE.
BUT
IT
TOOK
HIM
A
LONG
WHILE
FOR
THIS,
AND
THE
PAST
SEEMED
TO
HIM
AS
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
COVERED
BY
A
VEIL,
INFINITELY
DISTANT,
INFINITELY
FAR
AWAY,
INFINITELY
MEANINGLESS.
HE
ONLY
KNEW
THAT
HIS
PREVIOUS
LIFE
(IN
THE
FIRST
MOMENT
WHEN
HE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IT,
THIS
PAST
LIFE
SEEMED
TO
HIM
LIKE
A
VERY
OLD,
PREVIOUS
INCARNATION,
LIKE
AN
EARLY
PRE-BIRTH
OF
HIS
PRESENT
SELF)--THAT
HIS
PREVIOUS
LIFE
HAD
BEEN
ABANDONED
BY
HIM,
THAT,
FULL
OF
DISGUST
AND
WRETCHEDNESS,
HE
HAD
EVEN
INTENDED
TO
THROW
HIS
LIFE
AWAY,
BUT
THAT
BY
A
RIVER,
UNDER
A
COCONUT-TREE,
HE
HAS
COME
TO
HIS
SENSES,
THE
HOLY
WORD
OM
ON
HIS
LIPS,
THAT
THEN
HE
HAD
FALLEN
ASLEEP
AND
HAD
NOW
WOKEN
UP
AND
WAS
LOOKING
AT
THE
WORLD
AS
A
NEW
MAN.
QUIETLY,
HE
SPOKE
THE
WORD
OM
TO
HIMSELF,
SPEAKING
WHICH
HE
HAD
FALLEN
ASLEEP,
AND
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM
AS
IF
HIS
ENTIRE
LONG
SLEEP
HAD
BEEN
NOTHING
BUT
A
LONG
MEDITATIVE
RECITATION
OF
OM,
A
THINKING
OF
OM,
A
SUBMERGENCE
AND
COMPLETE
ENTERING
INTO
OM,
INTO
THE
NAMELESS,
THE
PERFECTED.
WHAT
A
WONDERFUL
SLEEP
HAD
THIS
BEEN!
NEVER
BEFORE
BY
SLEEP,
HE
HAD
BEEN
THUS
REFRESHED,
THUS
RENEWED,
THUS
REJUVENATED!
PERHAPS,
HE
HAD
REALLY
DIED,
HAD
DROWNED
AND
WAS
REBORN
IN
A
NEW
BODY?
BUT
NO,
HE
KNEW
HIMSELF,
HE
KNEW
HIS
HAND
AND
HIS
FEET,
KNEW
THE
PLACE
WHERE
HE
LAY,
KNEW
THIS
SELF
IN
HIS
CHEST,
THIS
SIDDHARTHA,
THE
ECCENTRIC,
THE
WEIRD
ONE,
BUT
THIS
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
NEVERTHELESS
TRANSFORMED,
WAS
RENEWED,
WAS
STRANGELY
WELL
RESTED,
STRANGELY
AWAKE,
JOYFUL
AND
CURIOUS.
SIDDHARTHA
STRAIGHTENED
UP,
THEN
HE
SAW
A
PERSON
SITTING
OPPOSITE
TO
HIM,
AN
UNKNOWN
MAN,
A
MONK
IN
A
YELLOW
ROBE
WITH
A
SHAVEN
HEAD,
SITTING
IN
THE
POSITION
OF
PONDERING.
HE
OBSERVED
THE
MAN,
WHO
HAD
NEITHER
HAIR
ON
HIS
HEAD
NOR
A
BEARD,
AND
HE
HAD
NOT
OBSERVED
HIM
FOR
LONG
WHEN
HE
RECOGNISED
THIS
MONK
AS
GOVINDA,
THE
FRIEND
OF
HIS
YOUTH,
GOVINDA
WHO
HAD
TAKEN
HIS
REFUGE
WITH
THE
EXALTED
BUDDHA.
GOVINDA
HAD
AGED,
HE
TOO,
BUT
STILL
HIS
FACE
BORE
THE
SAME
FEATURES,
EXPRESSED
ZEAL,
FAITHFULNESS,
SEARCHING,
TIMIDNESS.
BUT
WHEN
GOVINDA
NOW,
SENSING
HIS
GAZE,
OPENED
HIS
EYES
AND
LOOKED
AT
HIM,
SIDDHARTHA
SAW
THAT
GOVINDA
DID
NOT
RECOGNISE
HIM.
GOVINDA
WAS
HAPPY
TO
FIND
HIM
AWAKE;
APPARENTLY,
HE
HAD
BEEN
SITTING
HERE
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
AND
BEEN
WAITING
FOR
HIM
TO
WAKE
UP,
THOUGH
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
HIM.
"I
HAVE
BEEN
SLEEPING,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA.
"HOWEVER
DID
YOU
GET
HERE?"
"YOU
HAVE
BEEN
SLEEPING,"
ANSWERED
GOVINDA.
"IT
IS
NOT
GOOD
TO
BE
SLEEPING
IN
SUCH
PLACES,
WHERE
SNAKES
OFTEN
ARE
AND
THE
ANIMALS
OF
THE
FOREST
HAVE
THEIR
PATHS.
I,
OH
SIR,
AM
A
FOLLOWER
OF
THE
EXALTED
GOTAMA,
THE
BUDDHA,
THE
SAKYAMUNI,
AND
HAVE
BEEN
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE
TOGETHER
WITH
SEVERAL
OF
US
ON
THIS
PATH,
WHEN
I
SAW
YOU
LYING
AND
SLEEPING
IN
A
PLACE
WHERE
IT
IS
DANGEROUS
TO
SLEEP.
THEREFORE,
I
SOUGHT
TO
WAKE
YOU
UP,
OH
SIR,
AND
SINCE
I
SAW
THAT
YOUR
SLEEP
WAS
VERY
DEEP,
I
STAYED
BEHIND
FROM
MY
GROUP
AND
SAT
WITH
YOU.
AND
THEN,
SO
IT
SEEMS,
I
HAVE
FALLEN
ASLEEP
MYSELF,
I
WHO
WANTED
TO
GUARD
YOUR
SLEEP.
BADLY,
I
HAVE
SERVED
YOU,
TIREDNESS
HAS
OVERWHELMED
ME.
BUT
NOW
THAT
YOU'RE
AWAKE,
LET
ME
GO
TO
CATCH
UP
WITH
MY
BROTHERS."
"I
THANK
YOU,
SAMANA,
FOR
WATCHING
OUT
OVER
MY
SLEEP,"
SPOKE
SIDDHARTHA.
"YOU'RE
FRIENDLY,
YOU
FOLLOWERS
OF
THE
EXALTED
ONE.
NOW
YOU
MAY
GO
THEN."
"I'M
GOING,
SIR.
MAY
YOU,
SIR,
ALWAYS
BE
IN
GOOD
HEALTH."
"I
THANK
YOU,
SAMANA."
GOVINDA
MADE
THE
GESTURE
OF
A
SALUTATION
AND
SAID:
"FAREWELL."
"FAREWELL,
GOVINDA,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA.
THE
MONK
STOPPED.
"PERMIT
ME
TO
ASK,
SIR,
FROM
WHERE
DO
YOU
KNOW
MY
NAME?"
NOW,
SIDDHARTHA
SMILED.
"I
KNOW
YOU,
OH
GOVINDA,
FROM
YOUR
FATHER'S
HUT,
AND
FROM
THE
SCHOOL
OF
THE
BRAHMANS,
AND
FROM
THE
OFFERINGS,
AND
FROM
OUR
WALK
TO
THE
SAMANAS,
AND
FROM
THAT
HOUR
WHEN
YOU
TOOK
YOUR
REFUGE
WITH
THE
EXALTED
ONE
IN
THE
GROVE
JETAVANA."
"YOU'RE
SIDDHARTHA,"
GOVINDA
EXCLAIMED
LOUDLY.
"NOW,
I'M
RECOGNISING
YOU,
AND
DON'T
COMPREHEND
ANY
MORE
HOW
I
COULDN'T
RECOGNISE
YOU
RIGHT
AWAY.
BE
WELCOME,
SIDDHARTHA,
MY
JOY
IS
GREAT,
TO
SEE
YOU
AGAIN."
"IT
ALSO
GIVES
ME
JOY,
TO
SEE
YOU
AGAIN.
YOU'VE
BEEN
THE
GUARD
OF
MY
SLEEP,
AGAIN
I
THANK
YOU
FOR
THIS,
THOUGH
I
WOULDN'T
HAVE
REQUIRED
ANY
GUARD.
WHERE
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO,
OH
FRIEND?"
"I'M
GOING
NOWHERE.
WE
MONKS
ARE
ALWAYS
TRAVELLING,
WHENEVER
IT
IS
NOT
THE
RAINY
SEASON,
WE
ALWAYS
MOVE
FROM
ONE
PLACE
TO
ANOTHER,
LIVE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
RULES
IF
THE
TEACHINGS
PASSED
ON
TO
US,
ACCEPT
ALMS,
MOVE
ON.
IT
IS
ALWAYS
LIKE
THIS.
BUT
YOU,
SIDDHARTHA,
WHERE
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO?"
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"WITH
ME
TOO,
FRIEND,
IT
IS
AS
IT
IS
WITH
YOU.
I'M
GOING
NOWHERE.
I'M
JUST
TRAVELLING.
I'M
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE."
GOVINDA
SPOKE:
"YOU'RE
SAYING:
YOU'RE
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE,
AND
I
BELIEVE
IN
YOU.
BUT,
FORGIVE
ME,
OH
SIDDHARTHA,
YOU
DO
NOT
LOOK
LIKE
A
PILGRIM.
YOU'RE
WEARING
A
RICH
MAN'S
GARMENTS,
YOU'RE
WEARING
THE
SHOES
OF
A
DISTINGUISHED
GENTLEMAN,
AND
YOUR
HAIR,
WITH
THE
FRAGRANCE
OF
PERFUME,
IS
NOT
A
PILGRIM'S
HAIR,
NOT
THE
HAIR
OF
A
SAMANA."
"RIGHT
SO,
MY
DEAR,
YOU
HAVE
OBSERVED
WELL,
YOUR
KEEN
EYES
SEE
EVERYTHING.
BUT
I
HAVEN'T
SAID
TO
YOU
THAT
I
WAS
A
SAMANA.
I
SAID:
I'M
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE.
AND
SO
IT
IS:
I'M
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE."
"YOU'RE
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE,"
SAID
GOVINDA.
"BUT
FEW
WOULD
GO
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE
IN
SUCH
CLOTHES,
FEW
IN
SUCH
SHOES,
FEW
WITH
SUCH
HAIR.
NEVER
I
HAVE
MET
SUCH
A
PILGRIM,
BEING
A
PILGRIM
MYSELF
FOR
MANY
YEARS."
"I
BELIEVE
YOU,
MY
DEAR
GOVINDA.
BUT
NOW,
TODAY,
YOU'VE
MET
A
PILGRIM
JUST
LIKE
THIS,
WEARING
SUCH
SHOES,
SUCH
A
GARMENT.
REMEMBER,
MY
DEAR:
NOT
ETERNAL
IS
THE
WORLD
OF
APPEARANCES,
NOT
ETERNAL,
ANYTHING
BUT
ETERNAL
ARE
OUR
GARMENTS
AND
THE
STYLE
OF
OUR
HAIR,
AND
OUR
HAIR
AND
BODIES
THEMSELVES.
I'M
WEARING
A
RICH
MAN'S
CLOTHES,
YOU'VE
SEEN
THIS
QUITE
RIGHT.
I'M
WEARING
THEM,
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
BEEN
A
RICH
MAN,
AND
I'M
WEARING
MY
HAIR
LIKE
THE
WORLDLY
AND
LUSTFUL
PEOPLE,
FOR
I
HAVE
BEEN
ONE
OF
THEM."
"AND
NOW,
SIDDHARTHA,
WHAT
ARE
YOU
NOW?"
"I
DON'T
KNOW
IT,
I
DON'T
KNOW
IT
JUST
LIKE
YOU.
I'M
TRAVELLING.
I
WAS
A
RICH
MAN
AND
AM
NO
RICH
MAN
ANY
MORE,
AND
WHAT
I'LL
BE
TOMORROW,
I
DON'T
KNOW."
"YOU'VE
LOST
YOUR
RICHES?"
"I'VE
LOST
THEM
OR
THEY
ME.
THEY
SOMEHOW
HAPPENED
TO
SLIP
AWAY
FROM
ME.
THE
WHEEL
OF
PHYSICAL
MANIFESTATIONS
IS
TURNING
QUICKLY,
GOVINDA.
WHERE
IS
SIDDHARTHA
THE
BRAHMAN?
WHERE
IS
SIDDHARTHA
THE
SAMANA?
WHERE
IS
SIDDHARTHA
THE
RICH
MAN?
NON-ETERNAL
THINGS
CHANGE
QUICKLY,
GOVINDA,
YOU
KNOW
IT."
GOVINDA
LOOKED
AT
THE
FRIEND
OF
HIS
YOUTH
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
WITH
DOUBT
IN
HIS
EYES.
AFTER
THAT,
HE
GAVE
HIM
THE
SALUTATION
WHICH
ONE
WOULD
USE
ON
A
GENTLEMAN
AND
WENT
ON
HIS
WAY.
WITH
A
SMILING
FACE,
SIDDHARTHA
WATCHED
HIM
LEAVE,
HE
LOVED
HIM
STILL,
THIS
FAITHFUL
MAN,
THIS
FEARFUL
MAN.
AND
HOW
COULD
HE
NOT
HAVE
LOVED
EVERYBODY
AND
EVERYTHING
IN
THIS
MOMENT,
IN
THE
GLORIOUS
HOUR
AFTER
HIS
WONDERFUL
SLEEP,
FILLED
WITH
OM!
THE
ENCHANTMENT,
WHICH
HAD
HAPPENED
INSIDE
OF
HIM
IN
HIS
SLEEP
AND
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
OM,
WAS
THIS
VERY
THING
THAT
HE
LOVED
EVERYTHING,
THAT
HE
WAS
FULL
OF
JOYFUL
LOVE
FOR
EVERYTHING
HE
SAW.
AND
IT
WAS
THIS
VERY
THING,
SO
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM
NOW,
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
HIS
SICKNESS
BEFORE,
THAT
HE
WAS
NOT
ABLE
TO
LOVE
ANYBODY
OR
ANYTHING.
WITH
A
SMILING
FACE,
SIDDHARTHA
WATCHED
THE
LEAVING
MONK.
THE
SLEEP
HAD
STRENGTHENED
HIM
MUCH,
BUT
HUNGER
GAVE
HIM
MUCH
PAIN,
FOR
BY
NOW
HE
HAD
NOT
EATEN
FOR
TWO
DAYS,
AND
THE
TIMES
WERE
LONG
PAST
WHEN
HE
HAD
BEEN
TOUGH
AGAINST
HUNGER.
WITH
SADNESS,
AND
YET
ALSO
WITH
A
SMILE,
HE
THOUGHT
OF
THAT
TIME.
IN
THOSE
DAYS,
SO
HE
REMEMBERED,
HE
HAD
BOASTED
OF
THREE
THINGS
TO
KAMALA,
HAD
BEEN
ABLE
TO
DO
THREE
NOBLE
AND
UNDEFEATABLE
FEATS:
FASTING--WAITING--THINKING.
THESE
HAD
BEEN
HIS
POSSESSION,
HIS
POWER
AND
STRENGTH,
HIS
SOLID
STAFF;
IN
THE
BUSY,
LABORIOUS
YEARS
OF
HIS
YOUTH,
HE
HAD
LEARNED
THESE
THREE
FEATS,
NOTHING
ELSE.
AND
NOW,
THEY
HAD
ABANDONED
HIM,
NONE
OF
THEM
WAS
HIS
ANY
MORE,
NEITHER
FASTING,
NOR
WAITING,
NOR
THINKING.
FOR
THE
MOST
WRETCHED
THINGS,
HE
HAD
GIVEN
THEM
UP,
FOR
WHAT
FADES
MOST
QUICKLY,
FOR
SENSUAL
LUST,
FOR
THE
GOOD
LIFE,
FOR
RICHES!
HIS
LIFE
HAD
INDEED
BEEN
STRANGE.
AND
NOW,
SO
IT
SEEMED,
NOW
HE
HAD
REALLY
BECOME
A
CHILDLIKE
PERSON.
SIDDHARTHA
THOUGHT
ABOUT
HIS
SITUATION.
THINKING
WAS
HARD
ON
HIM,
HE
DID
NOT
REALLY
FEEL
LIKE
IT,
BUT
HE
FORCED
HIMSELF.
NOW,
HE
THOUGHT,
SINCE
ALL
THESE
MOST
EASILY
PERISHING
THINGS
HAVE
SLIPPED
FROM
ME
AGAIN,
NOW
I'M
STANDING
HERE
UNDER
THE
SUN
AGAIN
JUST
AS
I
HAVE
BEEN
STANDING
HERE
A
LITTLE
CHILD,
NOTHING
IS
MINE,
I
HAVE
NO
ABILITIES,
THERE
IS
NOTHING
I
COULD
BRING
ABOUT,
I
HAVE
LEARNED
NOTHING.
HOW
WONDROUS
IS
THIS!
NOW,
THAT
I'M
NO
LONGER
YOUNG,
THAT
MY
HAIR
IS
ALREADY
HALF
GRAY,
THAT
MY
STRENGTH
IS
FADING,
NOW
I'M
STARTING
AGAIN
AT
THE
BEGINNING
AND
AS
A
CHILD!
AGAIN,
HE
HAD
TO
SMILE.
YES,
HIS
FATE
HAD
BEEN
STRANGE!
THINGS
WERE
GOING
DOWNHILL
WITH
HIM,
AND
NOW
HE
WAS
AGAIN
FACING
THE
WORLD
VOID
AND
NAKED
AND
STUPID.
BUT
HE
COULD
NOT
FEED
SAD
ABOUT
THIS,
NO,
HE
EVEN
FELT
A
GREAT
URGE
TO
LAUGH,
TO
LAUGH
ABOUT
HIMSELF,
TO
LAUGH
ABOUT
THIS
STRANGE,
FOOLISH
WORLD.
"THINGS
ARE
GOING
DOWNHILL
WITH
YOU!"
HE
SAID
TO
HIMSELF,
AND
LAUGHED
ABOUT
IT,
AND
AS
HE
WAS
SAYING
IT,
HE
HAPPENED
TO
GLANCE
AT
THE
RIVER,
AND
HE
ALSO
SAW
THE
RIVER
GOING
DOWNHILL,
ALWAYS
MOVING
ON
DOWNHILL,
AND
SINGING
AND
BEING
HAPPY
THROUGH
IT
ALL.
HE
LIKED
THIS
WELL,
KINDLY
HE
SMILED
AT
THE
RIVER.
WAS
THIS
NOT
THE
RIVER
IN
WHICH
HE
HAD
INTENDED
TO
DROWN
HIMSELF,
IN
PAST
TIMES,
A
HUNDRED
YEARS
AGO,
OR
HAD
HE
DREAMED
THIS?
WONDROUS
INDEED
WAS
MY
LIFE,
SO
HE
THOUGHT,
WONDROUS
DETOURS
IT
HAS
TAKEN.
AS
I
BOY,
I
HAD
ONLY
TO
DO
WITH
GODS
AND
OFFERINGS.
AS
A
YOUTH,
I
HAD
ONLY
TO
DO
WITH
ASCETICISM,
WITH
THINKING
AND
MEDITATION,
WAS
SEARCHING
FOR
BRAHMAN,
WORSHIPPED
THE
ETERNAL
IN
THE
ATMAN.
BUT
AS
A
YOUNG
MAN,
I
FOLLOWED
THE
PENITENTS,
LIVED
IN
THE
FOREST,
SUFFERED
OF
HEAT
AND
FROST,
LEARNED
TO
HUNGER,
TAUGHT
MY
BODY
TO
BECOME
DEAD.
WONDERFULLY,
SOON
AFTERWARDS,
INSIGHT
CAME
TOWARDS
ME
IN
THE
FORM
OF
THE
GREAT
BUDDHA'S
TEACHINGS,
I
FELT
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
ONENESS
OF
THE
WORLD
CIRCLING
IN
ME
LIKE
MY
OWN
BLOOD.
BUT
I
ALSO
HAD
TO
LEAVE
BUDDHA
AND
THE
GREAT
KNOWLEDGE.
I
WENT
AND
LEARNED
THE
ART
OF
LOVE
WITH
KAMALA,
LEARNED
TRADING
WITH
KAMASWAMI,
PILED
UP
MONEY,
WASTED
MONEY,
LEARNED
TO
LOVE
MY
STOMACH,
LEARNED
TO
PLEASE
MY
SENSES.
I
HAD
TO
SPEND
MANY
YEARS
LOSING
MY
SPIRIT,
TO
UNLEARN
THINKING
AGAIN,
TO
FORGET
THE
ONENESS.
ISN'T
IT
JUST
AS
IF
I
HAD
TURNED
SLOWLY
AND
ON
A
LONG
DETOUR
FROM
A
MAN
INTO
A
CHILD,
FROM
A
THINKER
INTO
A
CHILDLIKE
PERSON?
AND
YET,
THIS
PATH
HAS
BEEN
VERY
GOOD;
AND
YET,
THE
BIRD
IN
MY
CHEST
HAS
NOT
DIED.
BUT
WHAT
A
PATH
HAS
THIS
BEEN!
I
HAD
TO
PASS
THROUGH
SO
MUCH
STUPIDITY,
THROUGH
SO
MUCH
VICES,
THROUGH
SO
MANY
ERRORS,
THROUGH
SO
MUCH
DISGUST
AND
DISAPPOINTMENTS
AND
WOE,
JUST
TO
BECOME
A
CHILD
AGAIN
AND
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
START
OVER.
BUT
IT
WAS
RIGHT
SO,
MY
HEART
SAYS
"YES"
TO
IT,
MY
EYES
SMILE
TO
IT.
I'VE
HAD
TO
EXPERIENCE
DESPAIR,
I'VE
HAD
TO
SINK
DOWN
TO
THE
MOST
FOOLISH
ONE
OF
ALL
THOUGHTS,
TO
THE
THOUGHT
OF
SUICIDE,
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
EXPERIENCE
DIVINE
GRACE,
TO
HEAR
OM
AGAIN,
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SLEEP
PROPERLY
AND
AWAKE
PROPERLY
AGAIN.
I
HAD
TO
BECOME
A
FOOL,
TO
FIND
ATMAN
IN
ME
AGAIN.
I
HAD
TO
SIN,
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
LIVE
AGAIN.
WHERE
ELSE
MIGHT
MY
PATH
LEAD
ME
TO?
IT
IS
FOOLISH,
THIS
PATH,
IT
MOVES
IN
LOOPS,
PERHAPS
IT
IS
GOING
AROUND
IN
A
CIRCLE.
LET
IT
GO
AS
IT
LIKES,
I
WANT
TO
TAKE
IT.
WONDERFULLY,
HE
FELT
JOY
ROLLING
LIKE
WAVES
IN
HIS
CHEST.
WHEREVER
FROM,
HE
ASKED
HIS
HEART,
WHERE
FROM
DID
YOU
GET
THIS
HAPPINESS?
MIGHT
IT
COME
FROM
THAT
LONG,
GOOD
SLEEP,
WHICH
HAS
DONE
ME
SO
GOOD?
OR
FROM
THE
WORD
OM,
WHICH
I
SAID?
OR
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
I
HAVE
ESCAPED,
THAT
I
HAVE
COMPLETELY
FLED,
THAT
I
AM
FINALLY
FREE
AGAIN
AND
AM
STANDING
LIKE
A
CHILD
UNDER
THE
SKY?
OH
HOW
GOOD
IS
IT
TO
HAVE
FLED,
TO
HAVE
BECOME
FREE!
HOW
CLEAN
AND
BEAUTIFUL
IS
THE
AIR
HERE,
HOW
GOOD
TO
BREATHE!
THERE,
WHERE
I
RAN
AWAY
FROM,
THERE
EVERYTHING
SMELLED
OF
OINTMENTS,
OF
SPICES,
OF
WINE,
OF
EXCESS,
OF
SLOTH.
HOW
DID
I
HATE
THIS
WORLD
OF
THE
RICH,
OF
THOSE
WHO
REVEL
IN
FINE
FOOD,
OF
THE
GAMBLERS!
HOW
DID
I
HATE
MYSELF
FOR
STAYING
IN
THIS
TERRIBLE
WORLD
FOR
SO
LONG!
HOW
DID
I
HATE
MYSELF,
HAVE
DEPRIVE,
POISONED,
TORTURED
MYSELF,
HAVE
MADE
MYSELF
OLD
AND
EVIL!
NO,
NEVER
AGAIN
I
WILL,
AS
I
USED
TO
LIKE
DOING
SO
MUCH,
DELUDE
MYSELF
INTO
THINKING
THAT
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
WISE!
BUT
THIS
ONE
THING
I
HAVE
DONE
WELL,
THIS
I
LIKE,
THIS
I
MUST
PRAISE,
THAT
THERE
IS
NOW
AN
END
TO
THAT
HATRED
AGAINST
MYSELF,
TO
THAT
FOOLISH
AND
DREARY
LIFE!
I
PRAISE
YOU,
SIDDHARTHA,
AFTER
SO
MANY
YEARS
OF
FOOLISHNESS,
YOU
HAVE
ONCE
AGAIN
HAD
AN
IDEA,
HAVE
DONE
SOMETHING,
HAVE
HEARD
THE
BIRD
IN
YOUR
CHEST
SINGING
AND
HAVE
FOLLOWED
IT!
THUS
HE
PRAISED
HIMSELF,
FOUND
JOY
IN
HIMSELF,
LISTENED
CURIOUSLY
TO
HIS
STOMACH,
WHICH
WAS
RUMBLING
WITH
HUNGER.
HE
HAD
NOW,
SO
HE
FELT,
IN
THESE
RECENT
TIMES
AND
DAYS,
COMPLETELY
TASTED
AND
SPIT
OUT,
DEVOURED
UP
TO
THE
POINT
OF
DESPERATION
AND
DEATH,
A
PIECE
OF
SUFFERING,
A
PIECE
OF
MISERY.
LIKE
THIS,
IT
WAS
GOOD.
FOR
MUCH
LONGER,
HE
COULD
HAVE
STAYED
WITH
KAMASWAMI,
MADE
MONEY,
WASTED
MONEY,
FILLED
HIS
STOMACH,
AND
LET
HIS
SOUL
DIE
OF
THIRST;
FOR
MUCH
LONGER
HE
COULD
HAVE
LIVED
IN
THIS
SOFT,
WELL
UPHOLSTERED
HELL,
IF
THIS
HAD
NOT
HAPPENED:
THE
MOMENT
OF
COMPLETE
HOPELESSNESS
AND
DESPAIR,
THAT
MOST
EXTREME
MOMENT,
WHEN
HE
HANG
OVER
THE
RUSHING
WATERS
AND
WAS
READY
TO
DESTROY
HIMSELF.
THAT
HE
HAD
FELT
THIS
DESPAIR,
THIS
DEEP
DISGUST,
AND
THAT
HE
HAD
NOT
SUCCUMBED
TO
IT,
THAT
THE
BIRD,
THE
JOYFUL
SOURCE
AND
VOICE
IN
HIM
WAS
STILL
ALIVE
AFTER
ALL,
THIS
WAS
WHY
HE
FELT
JOY,
THIS
WAS
WHY
HE
LAUGHED,
THIS
WAS
WHY
HIS
FACE
WAS
SMILING
BRIGHTLY
UNDER
HIS
HAIR
WHICH
HAD
TURNED
GRAY.
"IT
IS
GOOD,"
HE
THOUGHT,
"TO
GET
A
TASTE
OF
EVERYTHING
FOR
ONESELF,
WHICH
ONE
NEEDS
TO
KNOW.
THAT
LUST
FOR
THE
WORLD
AND
RICHES
DO
NOT
BELONG
TO
THE
GOOD
THINGS,
I
HAVE
ALREADY
LEARNED
AS
A
CHILD.
I
HAVE
KNOWN
IT
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
BUT
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
ONLY
NOW.
AND
NOW
I
KNOW
IT,
DON'T
JUST
KNOW
IT
IN
MY
MEMORY,
BUT
IN
MY
EYES,
IN
MY
HEART,
IN
MY
STOMACH.
GOOD
FOR
ME,
TO
KNOW
THIS!"
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
PONDERED
HIS
TRANSFORMATION,
LISTENED
TO
THE
BIRD,
AS
IT
SANG
FOR
JOY.
HAD
NOT
THIS
BIRD
DIED
IN
HIM,
HAD
HE
NOT
FELT
ITS
DEATH?
NO,
SOMETHING
ELSE
FROM
WITHIN
HIM
HAD
DIED,
SOMETHING
WHICH
ALREADY
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
HAD
YEARNED
TO
DIE.
WAS
IT
NOT
THIS
WHAT
HE
USED
TO
INTEND
TO
KILL
IN
HIS
ARDENT
YEARS
AS
A
PENITENT?
WAS
THIS
NOT
HIS
SELF,
HIS
SMALL,
FRIGHTENED,
AND
PROUD
SELF,
HE
HAD
WRESTLED
WITH
FOR
SO
MANY
YEARS,
WHICH
HAD
DEFEATED
HIM
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN,
WHICH
WAS
BACK
AGAIN
AFTER
EVERY
KILLING,
PROHIBITED
JOY,
FELT
FEAR?
WAS
IT
NOT
THIS,
WHICH
TODAY
HAD
FINALLY
COME
TO
ITS
DEATH,
HERE
IN
THE
FOREST,
BY
THIS
LOVELY
RIVER?
WAS
IT
NOT
DUE
TO
THIS
DEATH,
THAT
HE
WAS
NOW
LIKE
A
CHILD,
SO
FULL
OF
TRUST,
SO
WITHOUT
FEAR,
SO
FULL
OF
JOY?
NOW
SIDDHARTHA
ALSO
GOT
SOME
IDEA
OF
WHY
HE
HAD
FOUGHT
THIS
SELF
IN
VAIN
AS
A
BRAHMAN,
AS
A
PENITENT.
TOO
MUCH
KNOWLEDGE
HAD
HELD
HIM
BACK,
TOO
MANY
HOLY
VERSES,
TOO
MANY
SACRIFICIAL
RULES,
TO
MUCH
SELF-CASTIGATION,
SO
MUCH
DOING
AND
STRIVING
FOR
THAT
GOAL!
FULL
OF
ARROGANCE,
HE
HAD
BEEN,
ALWAYS
THE
SMARTEST,
ALWAYS
WORKING
THE
MOST,
ALWAYS
ONE
STEP
AHEAD
OF
ALL
OTHERS,
ALWAYS
THE
KNOWING
AND
SPIRITUAL
ONE,
ALWAYS
THE
PRIEST
OR
WISE
ONE.
INTO
BEING
A
PRIEST,
INTO
THIS
ARROGANCE,
INTO
THIS
SPIRITUALITY,
HIS
SELF
HAD
RETREATED,
THERE
IT
SAT
FIRMLY
AND
GREW,
WHILE
HE
THOUGHT
HE
WOULD
KILL
IT
BY
FASTING
AND
PENANCE.
NOW
HE
SAW
IT
AND
SAW
THAT
THE
SECRET
VOICE
HAD
BEEN
RIGHT,
THAT
NO
TEACHER
WOULD
EVER
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
BRING
ABOUT
HIS
SALVATION.
THEREFORE,
HE
HAD
TO
GO
OUT
INTO
THE
WORLD,
LOSE
HIMSELF
TO
LUST
AND
POWER,
TO
WOMAN
AND
MONEY,
HAD
TO
BECOME
A
MERCHANT,
A
DICE-GAMBLER,
A
DRINKER,
AND
A
GREEDY
PERSON,
UNTIL
THE
PRIEST
AND
SAMANA
IN
HIM
WAS
DEAD.
THEREFORE,
HE
HAD
TO
CONTINUE
BEARING
THESE
UGLY
YEARS,
BEARING
THE
DISGUST,
THE
TEACHINGS,
THE
POINTLESSNESS
OF
A
DREARY
AND
WASTED
LIFE
UP
TO
THE
END,
UP
TO
BITTER
DESPAIR,
UNTIL
SIDDHARTHA
THE
LUSTFUL,
SIDDHARTHA
THE
GREEDY
COULD
ALSO
DIE.
HE
HAD
DIED,
A
NEW
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
WOKEN
UP
FROM
THE
SLEEP.
HE
WOULD
ALSO
GROW
OLD,
HE
WOULD
ALSO
EVENTUALLY
HAVE
TO
DIE,
MORTAL
WAS
SIDDHARTHA,
MORTAL
WAS
EVERY
PHYSICAL
FORM.
BUT
TODAY
HE
WAS
YOUNG,
WAS
A
CHILD,
THE
NEW
SIDDHARTHA,
AND
WAS
FULL
OF
JOY.
HE
THOUGHT
THESE
THOUGHTS,
LISTENED
WITH
A
SMILE
TO
HIS
STOMACH,
LISTENED
GRATEFULLY
TO
A
BUZZING
BEE.
CHEERFULLY,
HE
LOOKED
INTO
THE
RUSHING
RIVER,
NEVER
BEFORE
HE
HAD
LIKE
A
WATER
SO
WELL
AS
THIS
ONE,
NEVER
BEFORE
HE
HAD
PERCEIVED
THE
VOICE
AND
THE
PARABLE
OF
THE
MOVING
WATER
THUS
STRONGLY
AND
BEAUTIFULLY.
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM,
AS
IF
THE
RIVER
HAD
SOMETHING
SPECIAL
TO
TELL
HIM,
SOMETHING
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
YET,
WHICH
WAS
STILL
AWAITING
HIM.
IN
THIS
RIVER,
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
INTENDED
TO
DROWN
HIMSELF,
IN
IT
THE
OLD,
TIRED,
DESPERATE
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
DROWNED
TODAY.
BUT
THE
NEW
SIDDHARTHA
FELT
A
DEEP
LOVE
FOR
THIS
RUSHING
WATER,
AND
DECIDED
FOR
HIMSELF,
NOT
TO
LEAVE
IT
VERY
SOON.
THE
FERRYMAN
BY
THIS
RIVER
I
WANT
TO
STAY,
THOUGHT
SIDDHARTHA,
IT
IS
THE
SAME
WHICH
I
HAVE
CROSSED
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
ON
MY
WAY
TO
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE,
A
FRIENDLY
FERRYMAN
HAD
GUIDED
ME
THEN,
HE
IS
THE
ONE
I
WANT
TO
GO
TO,
STARTING
OUT
FROM
HIS
HUT,
MY
PATH
HAD
LED
ME
AT
THAT
TIME
INTO
A
NEW
LIFE,
WHICH
HAD
NOW
GROWN
OLD
AND
IS
DEAD--MY
PRESENT
PATH,
MY
PRESENT
NEW
LIFE,
SHALL
ALSO
TAKE
ITS
START
THERE!
TENDERLY,
HE
LOOKED
INTO
THE
RUSHING
WATER,
INTO
THE
TRANSPARENT
GREEN,
INTO
THE
CRYSTAL
LINES
OF
ITS
DRAWING,
SO
RICH
IN
SECRETS.
BRIGHT
PEARLS
HE
SAW
RISING
FROM
THE
DEEP,
QUIET
BUBBLES
OF
AIR
FLOATING
ON
THE
REFLECTING
SURFACE,
THE
BLUE
OF
THE
SKY
BEING
DEPICTED
IN
IT.
WITH
A
THOUSAND
EYES,
THE
RIVER
LOOKED
AT
HIM,
WITH
GREEN
ONES,
WITH
WHITE
ONES,
WITH
CRYSTAL
ONES,
WITH
SKY-BLUE
ONES.
HOW
DID
HE
LOVE
THIS
WATER,
HOW
DID
IT
DELIGHT
HIM,
HOW
GRATEFUL
WAS
HE
TO
IT!
IN
HIS
HEART
HE
HEARD
THE
VOICE
TALKING,
WHICH
WAS
NEWLY
AWAKING,
AND
IT
TOLD
HIM:
LOVE
THIS
WATER!
STAY
NEAR
IT!
LEARN
FROM
IT!
OH
YES,
HE
WANTED
TO
LEARN
FROM
IT,
HE
WANTED
TO
LISTEN
TO
IT.
HE
WHO
WOULD
UNDERSTAND
THIS
WATER
AND
ITS
SECRETS,
SO
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM,
WOULD
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
MANY
OTHER
THINGS,
MANY
SECRETS,
ALL
SECRETS.
BUT
OUT
OF
ALL
SECRETS
OF
THE
RIVER,
HE
TODAY
ONLY
SAW
ONE,
THIS
ONE
TOUCHED
HIS
SOUL.
HE
SAW:
THIS
WATER
RAN
AND
RAN,
INCESSANTLY
IT
RAN,
AND
WAS
NEVERTHELESS
ALWAYS
THERE,
WAS
ALWAYS
AT
ALL
TIMES
THE
SAME
AND
YET
NEW
IN
EVERY
MOMENT!
GREAT
BE
HE
WHO
WOULD
GRASP
THIS,
UNDERSTAND
THIS!
HE
UNDERSTOOD
AND
GRASPED
IT
NOT,
ONLY
FELT
SOME
IDEA
OF
IT
STIRRING,
A
DISTANT
MEMORY,
DIVINE
VOICES.
SIDDHARTHA
ROSE,
THE
WORKINGS
OF
HUNGER
IN
HIS
BODY
BECAME
UNBEARABLE.
IN
A
DAZE
HE
WALKED
ON,
UP
THE
PATH
BY
THE
BANK,
UPRIVER,
LISTENED
TO
THE
CURRENT,
LISTENED
TO
THE
RUMBLING
HUNGER
IN
HIS
BODY.
WHEN
HE
REACHED
THE
FERRY,
THE
BOAT
WAS
JUST
READY,
AND
THE
SAME
FERRYMAN
WHO
HAD
ONCE
TRANSPORTED
THE
YOUNG
SAMANA
ACROSS
THE
RIVER,
STOOD
IN
THE
BOAT,
SIDDHARTHA
RECOGNISED
HIM,
HE
HAD
ALSO
AGED
VERY
MUCH.
"WOULD
YOU
LIKE
TO
FERRY
ME
OVER?"
HE
ASKED.
THE
FERRYMAN,
BEING
ASTONISHED
TO
SEE
SUCH
AN
ELEGANT
MAN
WALKING
ALONG
AND
ON
FOOT,
TOOK
HIM
INTO
HIS
BOAT
AND
PUSHED
IT
OFF
THE
BANK.
"IT'S
A
BEAUTIFUL
LIFE
YOU
HAVE
CHOSEN
FOR
YOURSELF,"
THE
PASSENGER
SPOKE.
"IT
MUST
BE
BEAUTIFUL
TO
LIVE
BY
THIS
WATER
EVERY
DAY
AND
TO
CRUISE
ON
IT."
WITH
A
SMILE,
THE
MAN
AT
THE
OAR
MOVED
FROM
SIDE
TO
SIDE:
"IT
IS
BEAUTIFUL,
SIR,
IT
IS
AS
YOU
SAY.
BUT
ISN'T
EVERY
LIFE,
ISN'T
EVERY
WORK
BEAUTIFUL?"
"THIS
MAY
BE
TRUE.
BUT
I
ENVY
YOU
FOR
YOURS."
"AH,
YOU
WOULD
SOON
STOP
ENJOYING
IT.
THIS
IS
NOTHING
FOR
PEOPLE
WEARING
FINE
CLOTHES."
SIDDHARTHA
LAUGHED.
"ONCE
BEFORE,
I
HAVE
BEEN
LOOKED
UPON
TODAY
BECAUSE
OF
MY
CLOTHES,
I
HAVE
BEEN
LOOKED
UPON
WITH
DISTRUST.
WOULDN'T
YOU,
FERRYMAN,
LIKE
TO
ACCEPT
THESE
CLOTHES,
WHICH
ARE
A
NUISANCE
TO
ME,
FROM
ME?
FOR
YOU
MUST
KNOW,
I
HAVE
NO
MONEY
TO
PAY
YOUR
FARE."
"YOU'RE
JOKING,
SIR,"
THE
FERRYMAN
LAUGHED.
"I'M
NOT
JOKING,
FRIEND.
BEHOLD,
ONCE
BEFORE
YOU
HAVE
FERRIED
ME
ACROSS
THIS
WATER
IN
YOUR
BOAT
FOR
THE
IMMATERIAL
REWARD
OF
A
GOOD
DEED.
THUS,
DO
IT
TODAY
AS
WELL,
AND
ACCEPT
MY
CLOTHES
FOR
IT."
"AND
DO
YOU,
SIR,
INTENT
TO
CONTINUE
TRAVELLING
WITHOUT
CLOTHES?"
"AH,
MOST
OF
ALL
I
WOULDN'T
WANT
TO
CONTINUE
TRAVELLING
AT
ALL.
MOST
OF
ALL
I
WOULD
LIKE
YOU,
FERRYMAN,
TO
GIVE
ME
AN
OLD
LOINCLOTH
AND
KEPT
ME
WITH
YOU
AS
YOUR
ASSISTANT,
OR
RATHER
AS
YOUR
TRAINEE,
FOR
I'LL
HAVE
TO
LEARN
FIRST
HOW
TO
HANDLE
THE
BOAT."
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
THE
FERRYMAN
LOOKED
AT
THE
STRANGER,
SEARCHING.
"NOW
I
RECOGNISE
YOU,"
HE
FINALLY
SAID.
"AT
ONE
TIME,
YOU'VE
SLEPT
IN
MY
HUT,
THIS
WAS
A
LONG
TIME
AGO,
POSSIBLY
MORE
THAN
TWENTY
YEARS
AGO,
AND
YOU'VE
BEEN
FERRIED
ACROSS
THE
RIVER
BY
ME,
AND
WE
PARTED
LIKE
GOOD
FRIENDS.
HAVEN'T
YOU'VE
BEEN
A
SAMANA?
I
CAN'T
THINK
OF
YOUR
NAME
ANY
MORE."
"MY
NAME
IS
SIDDHARTHA,
AND
I
WAS
A
SAMANA,
WHEN
YOU'VE
LAST
SEEN
ME."
"SO
BE
WELCOME,
SIDDHARTHA.
MY
NAME
IS
VASUDEVA.
YOU
WILL,
SO
I
HOPE,
BE
MY
GUEST
TODAY
AS
WELL
AND
SLEEP
IN
MY
HUT,
AND
TELL
ME,
WHERE
YOU'RE
COMING
FROM
AND
WHY
THESE
BEAUTIFUL
CLOTHES
ARE
SUCH
A
NUISANCE
TO
YOU."
THEY
HAD
REACHED
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
RIVER,
AND
VASUDEVA
PUSHED
THE
OAR
WITH
MORE
STRENGTH,
IN
ORDER
TO
OVERCOME
THE
CURRENT.
HE
WORKED
CALMLY,
HIS
EYES
FIXED
IN
ON
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
BOAT,
WITH
BRAWNY
ARMS.
SIDDHARTHA
SAT
AND
WATCHED
HIM,
AND
REMEMBERED,
HOW
ONCE
BEFORE,
ON
THAT
LAST
DAY
OF
HIS
TIME
AS
A
SAMANA,
LOVE
FOR
THIS
MAN
HAD
STIRRED
IN
HIS
HEART.
GRATEFULLY,
HE
ACCEPTED
VASUDEVA'S
INVITATION.
WHEN
THEY
HAD
REACHED
THE
BANK,
HE
HELPED
HIM
TO
TIE
THE
BOAT
TO
THE
STAKES;
AFTER
THIS,
THE
FERRYMAN
ASKED
HIM
TO
ENTER
THE
HUT,
OFFERED
HIM
BREAD
AND
WATER,
AND
SIDDHARTHA
ATE
WITH
EAGER
PLEASURE,
AND
ALSO
ATE
WITH
EAGER
PLEASURE
OF
THE
MANGO
FRUITS,
VASUDEVA
OFFERED
HIM.
AFTERWARDS,
IT
WAS
ALMOST
THE
TIME
OF
THE
SUNSET,
THEY
SAT
ON
A
LOG
BY
THE
BANK,
AND
SIDDHARTHA
TOLD
THE
FERRYMAN
ABOUT
WHERE
HE
ORIGINALLY
CAME
FROM
AND
ABOUT
HIS
LIFE,
AS
HE
HAD
SEEN
IT
BEFORE
HIS
EYES
TODAY,
IN
THAT
HOUR
OF
DESPAIR.
UNTIL
LATE
AT
NIGHT,
LASTED
HIS
TALE.
VASUDEVA
LISTENED
WITH
GREAT
ATTENTION.
LISTENING
CAREFULLY,
HE
LET
EVERYTHING
ENTER
HIS
MIND,
BIRTHPLACE
AND
CHILDHOOD,
ALL
THAT
LEARNING,
ALL
THAT
SEARCHING,
ALL
JOY,
ALL
DISTRESS.
THIS
WAS
AMONG
THE
FERRYMAN'S
VIRTUES
ONE
OF
THE
GREATEST:
LIKE
ONLY
A
FEW,
HE
KNEW
HOW
TO
LISTEN.
WITHOUT
HIM
HAVING
SPOKEN
A
WORD,
THE
SPEAKER
SENSED
HOW
VASUDEVA
LET
HIS
WORDS
ENTER
HIS
MIND,
QUIET,
OPEN,
WAITING,
HOW
HE
DID
NOT
LOSE
A
SINGLE
ONE,
AWAITED
NOT
A
SINGLE
ONE
WITH
IMPATIENCE,
DID
NOT
ADD
HIS
PRAISE
OR
REBUKE,
WAS
JUST
LISTENING.
SIDDHARTHA
FELT,
WHAT
A
HAPPY
FORTUNE
IT
IS,
TO
CONFESS
TO
SUCH
A
LISTENER,
TO
BURY
IN
HIS
HEART
HIS
OWN
LIFE,
HIS
OWN
SEARCH,
HIS
OWN
SUFFERING.
BUT
IN
THE
END
OF
SIDDHARTHA'S
TALE,
WHEN
HE
SPOKE
OF
THE
TREE
BY
THE
RIVER,
AND
OF
HIS
DEEP
FALL,
OF
THE
HOLY
OM,
AND
HOW
HE
HAD
FELT
SUCH
A
LOVE
FOR
THE
RIVER
AFTER
HIS
SLUMBER,
THE
FERRYMAN
LISTENED
WITH
TWICE
THE
ATTENTION,
ENTIRELY
AND
COMPLETELY
ABSORBED
BY
IT,
WITH
HIS
EYES
CLOSED.
BUT
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
FELL
SILENT,
AND
A
LONG
SILENCE
HAD
OCCURRED,
THEN
VASUDEVA
SAID:
"IT
IS
AS
I
THOUGHT.
THE
RIVER
HAS
SPOKEN
TO
YOU.
IT
IS
YOUR
FRIEND
AS
WELL,
IT
SPEAKS
TO
YOU
AS
WELL.
THAT
IS
GOOD,
THAT
IS
VERY
GOOD.
STAY
WITH
ME,
SIDDHARTHA,
MY
FRIEND.
I
USED
TO
HAVE
A
WIFE,
HER
BED
WAS
NEXT
TO
MINE,
BUT
SHE
HAS
DIED
A
LONG
TIME
AGO,
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
I
HAVE
LIVED
ALONE.
NOW,
YOU
SHALL
LIVE
WITH
ME,
THERE
IS
SPACE
AND
FOOD
FOR
BOTH."
"I
THANK
YOU,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA,
"I
THANK
YOU
AND
ACCEPT.
AND
I
ALSO
THANK
YOU
FOR
THIS,
VASUDEVA,
FOR
LISTENING
TO
ME
SO
WELL!
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
RARE
WHO
KNOW
HOW
TO
LISTEN.
AND
I
DID
NOT
MEET
A
SINGLE
ONE
WHO
KNEW
IT
AS
WELL
AS
YOU
DID.
I
WILL
ALSO
LEARN
IN
THIS
RESPECT
FROM
YOU."
"YOU
WILL
LEARN
IT,"
SPOKE
VASUDEVA,
"BUT
NOT
FROM
ME.
THE
RIVER
HAS
TAUGHT
ME
TO
LISTEN,
FROM
IT
YOU
WILL
LEARN
IT
AS
WELL.
IT
KNOWS
EVERYTHING,
THE
RIVER,
EVERYTHING
CAN
BE
LEARNED
FROM
IT.
SEE,
YOU'VE
ALREADY
LEARNED
THIS
FROM
THE
WATER
TOO,
THAT
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
STRIVE
DOWNWARDS,
TO
SINK,
TO
SEEK
DEPTH.
THE
RICH
AND
ELEGANT
SIDDHARTHA
IS
BECOMING
AN
OARSMAN'S
SERVANT,
THE
LEARNED
BRAHMAN
SIDDHARTHA
BECOMES
A
FERRYMAN:
THIS
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
TOLD
TO
YOU
BY
THE
RIVER.
YOU'LL
LEARN
THAT
OTHER
THING
FROM
IT
AS
WELL."
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA
AFTER
A
LONG
PAUSE:
"WHAT
OTHER
THING,
VASUDEVA?"
VASUDEVA
ROSE.
"IT
IS
LATE,"
HE
SAID,
"LET'S
GO
TO
SLEEP.
I
CAN'T
TELL
YOU
THAT
OTHER
THING,
OH
FRIEND.
YOU'LL
LEARN
IT,
OR
PERHAPS
YOU
KNOW
IT
ALREADY.
SEE,
I'M
NO
LEARNED
MAN,
I
HAVE
NO
SPECIAL
SKILL
IN
SPEAKING,
I
ALSO
HAVE
NO
SPECIAL
SKILL
IN
THINKING.
ALL
I'M
ABLE
TO
DO
IS
TO
LISTEN
AND
TO
BE
GODLY,
I
HAVE
LEARNED
NOTHING
ELSE.
IF
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
SAY
AND
TEACH
IT,
I
MIGHT
BE
A
WISE
MAN,
BUT
LIKE
THIS
I
AM
ONLY
A
FERRYMAN,
AND
IT
IS
MY
TASK
TO
FERRY
PEOPLE
ACROSS
THE
RIVER.
I
HAVE
TRANSPORTED
MANY,
THOUSANDS;
AND
TO
ALL
OF
THEM,
MY
RIVER
HAS
BEEN
NOTHING
BUT
AN
OBSTACLE
ON
THEIR
TRAVELS.
THEY
TRAVELLED
TO
SEEK
MONEY
AND
BUSINESS,
AND
FOR
WEDDINGS,
AND
ON
PILGRIMAGES,
AND
THE
RIVER
WAS
OBSTRUCTING
THEIR
PATH,
AND
THE
FERRYMAN'S
JOB
WAS
TO
GET
THEM
QUICKLY
ACROSS
THAT
OBSTACLE.
BUT
FOR
SOME
AMONG
THOUSANDS,
A
FEW,
FOUR
OR
FIVE,
THE
RIVER
HAS
STOPPED
BEING
AN
OBSTACLE,
THEY
HAVE
HEARD
ITS
VOICE,
THEY
HAVE
LISTENED
TO
IT,
AND
THE
RIVER
HAS
BECOME
SACRED
TO
THEM,
AS
IT
HAS
BECOME
SACRED
TO
ME.
LET'S
REST
NOW,
SIDDHARTHA."
SIDDHARTHA
STAYED
WITH
THE
FERRYMAN
AND
LEARNED
TO
OPERATE
THE
BOAT,
AND
WHEN
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
AT
THE
FERRY,
HE
WORKED
WITH
VASUDEVA
IN
THE
RICE-FIELD,
GATHERED
WOOD,
PLUCKED
THE
FRUIT
OFF
THE
BANANA-TREES.
HE
LEARNED
TO
BUILD
AN
OAR,
AND
LEARNED
TO
MEND
THE
BOAT,
AND
TO
WEAVE
BASKETS,
AND
WAS
JOYFUL
BECAUSE
OF
EVERYTHING
HE
LEARNED,
AND
THE
DAYS
AND
MONTHS
PASSED
QUICKLY.
BUT
MORE
THAN
VASUDEVA
COULD
TEACH
HIM,
HE
WAS
TAUGHT
BY
THE
RIVER.
INCESSANTLY,
HE
LEARNED
FROM
IT.
MOST
OF
ALL,
HE
LEARNED
FROM
IT
TO
LISTEN,
TO
PAY
CLOSE
ATTENTION
WITH
A
QUIET
HEART,
WITH
A
WAITING,
OPENED
SOUL,
WITHOUT
PASSION,
WITHOUT
A
WISH,
WITHOUT
JUDGEMENT,
WITHOUT
AN
OPINION.
IN
A
FRIENDLY
MANNER,
HE
LIVED
SIDE
BY
SIDE
WITH
VASUDEVA,
AND
OCCASIONALLY
THEY
EXCHANGED
SOME
WORDS,
FEW
AND
AT
LENGTH
THOUGHT
ABOUT
WORDS.
VASUDEVA
WAS
NO
FRIEND
OF
WORDS;
RARELY,
SIDDHARTHA
SUCCEEDED
IN
PERSUADING
HIM
TO
SPEAK.
"DID
YOU,"
SO
HE
ASKED
HIM
AT
ONE
TIME,
"DID
YOU
TOO
LEARN
THAT
SECRET
FROM
THE
RIVER:
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
TIME?"
VASUDEVA'S
FACE
WAS
FILLED
WITH
A
BRIGHT
SMILE.
"YES,
SIDDHARTHA,"
HE
SPOKE.
"IT
IS
THIS
WHAT
YOU
MEAN,
ISN'T
IT:
THAT
THE
RIVER
IS
EVERYWHERE
AT
ONCE,
AT
THE
SOURCE
AND
AT
THE
MOUTH,
AT
THE
WATERFALL,
AT
THE
FERRY,
AT
THE
RAPIDS,
IN
THE
SEA,
IN
THE
MOUNTAINS,
EVERYWHERE
AT
ONCE,
AND
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
THE
PRESENT
TIME
FOR
IT,
NOT
THE
SHADOW
OF
THE
PAST,
NOT
THE
SHADOW
OF
THE
FUTURE?"
"THIS
IT
IS,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA.
"AND
WHEN
I
HAD
LEARNED
IT,
I
LOOKED
AT
MY
LIFE,
AND
IT
WAS
ALSO
A
RIVER,
AND
THE
BOY
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
ONLY
SEPARATED
FROM
THE
MAN
SIDDHARTHA
AND
FROM
THE
OLD
MAN
SIDDHARTHA
BY
A
SHADOW,
NOT
BY
SOMETHING
REAL.
ALSO,
SIDDHARTHA'S
PREVIOUS
BIRTHS
WERE
NO
PAST,
AND
HIS
DEATH
AND
HIS
RETURN
TO
BRAHMA
WAS
NO
FUTURE.
NOTHING
WAS,
NOTHING
WILL
BE;
EVERYTHING
IS,
EVERYTHING
HAS
EXISTENCE
AND
IS
PRESENT."
SIDDHARTHA
SPOKE
WITH
ECSTASY;
DEEPLY,
THIS
ENLIGHTENMENT
HAD
DELIGHTED
HIM.
OH,
WAS
NOT
ALL
SUFFERING
TIME,
WERE
NOT
ALL
FORMS
OF
TORMENTING
ONESELF
AND
BEING
AFRAID
TIME,
WAS
NOT
EVERYTHING
HARD,
EVERYTHING
HOSTILE
IN
THE
WORLD
GONE
AND
OVERCOME
AS
SOON
AS
ONE
HAD
OVERCOME
TIME,
AS
SOON
AS
TIME
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PUT
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE
BY
ONE'S
THOUGHTS?
IN
ECSTATIC
DELIGHT,
HE
HAD
SPOKEN,
BUT
VASUDEVA
SMILED
AT
HIM
BRIGHTLY
AND
NODDED
IN
CONFIRMATION;
SILENTLY
HE
NODDED,
BRUSHED
HIS
HAND
OVER
SIDDHARTHA'S
SHOULDER,
TURNED
BACK
TO
HIS
WORK.
AND
ONCE
AGAIN,
WHEN
THE
RIVER
HAD
JUST
INCREASED
ITS
FLOW
IN
THE
RAINY
SEASON
AND
MADE
A
POWERFUL
NOISE,
THEN
SAID
SIDDHARTHA:
"ISN'T
IT
SO,
OH
FRIEND,
THE
RIVER
HAS
MANY
VOICES,
VERY
MANY
VOICES?
HASN'T
IT
THE
VOICE
OF
A
KING,
AND
OF
A
WARRIOR,
AND
OF
A
BULL,
AND
OF
A
BIRD
OF
THE
NIGHT,
AND
OF
A
WOMAN
GIVING
BIRTH,
AND
OF
A
SIGHING
MAN,
AND
A
THOUSAND
OTHER
VOICES
MORE?"
"SO
IT
IS,"
VASUDEVA
NODDED,
"ALL
VOICES
OF
THE
CREATURES
ARE
IN
ITS
VOICE."
"AND
DO
YOU
KNOW,"
SIDDHARTHA
CONTINUED,
"WHAT
WORD
IT
SPEAKS,
WHEN
YOU
SUCCEED
IN
HEARING
ALL
OF
ITS
TEN
THOUSAND
VOICES
AT
ONCE?"
HAPPILY,
VASUDEVA'S
FACE
WAS
SMILING,
HE
BENT
OVER
TO
SIDDHARTHA
AND
SPOKE
THE
HOLY
OM
INTO
HIS
EAR.
AND
THIS
HAD
BEEN
THE
VERY
THING
WHICH
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
ALSO
BEEN
HEARING.
AND
TIME
AFTER
TIME,
HIS
SMILE
BECAME
MORE
SIMILAR
TO
THE
FERRYMAN'S,
BECAME
ALMOST
JUST
AS
BRIGHT,
ALMOST
JUST
AS
THROUGHLY
GLOWING
WITH
BLISS,
JUST
AS
SHINING
OUT
OF
THOUSAND
SMALL
WRINKLES,
JUST
AS
ALIKE
TO
A
CHILD'S,
JUST
AS
ALIKE
TO
AN
OLD
MAN'S.
MANY
TRAVELLERS,
SEEING
THE
TWO
FERRYMEN,
THOUGHT
THEY
WERE
BROTHERS.
OFTEN,
THEY
SAT
IN
THE
EVENING
TOGETHER
BY
THE
BANK
ON
THE
LOG,
SAID
NOTHING
AND
BOTH
LISTENED
TO
THE
WATER,
WHICH
WAS
NO
WATER
TO
THEM,
BUT
THE
VOICE
OF
LIFE,
THE
VOICE
OF
WHAT
EXISTS,
OF
WHAT
IS
ETERNALLY
TAKING
SHAPE.
AND
IT
HAPPENED
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
THAT
BOTH,
WHEN
LISTENING
TO
THE
RIVER,
THOUGHT
OF
THE
SAME
THINGS,
OF
A
CONVERSATION
FROM
THE
DAY
BEFORE
YESTERDAY,
OF
ONE
OF
THEIR
TRAVELLERS,
THE
FACE
AND
FATE
OF
WHOM
HAD
OCCUPIED
THEIR
THOUGHTS,
OF
DEATH,
OF
THEIR
CHILDHOOD,
AND
THAT
THEY
BOTH
IN
THE
SAME
MOMENT,
WHEN
THE
RIVER
HAD
BEEN
SAYING
SOMETHING
GOOD
TO
THEM,
LOOKED
AT
EACH
OTHER,
BOTH
THINKING
PRECISELY
THE
SAME
THING,
BOTH
DELIGHTED
ABOUT
THE
SAME
ANSWER
TO
THE
SAME
QUESTION.
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THIS
FERRY
AND
THE
TWO
FERRYMEN
WHICH
WAS
TRANSMITTED
TO
OTHERS,
WHICH
MANY
OF
THE
TRAVELLERS
FELT.
IT
HAPPENED
OCCASIONALLY
THAT
A
TRAVELLER,
AFTER
HAVING
LOOKED
AT
THE
FACE
OF
ONE
OF
THE
FERRYMEN,
STARTED
TO
TELL
THE
STORY
OF
HIS
LIFE,
TOLD
ABOUT
PAINS,
CONFESSED
EVIL
THINGS,
ASKED
FOR
COMFORT
AND
ADVICE.
IT
HAPPENED
OCCASIONALLY
THAT
SOMEONE
ASKED
FOR
PERMISSION
TO
STAY
FOR
A
NIGHT
WITH
THEM
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
RIVER.
IT
ALSO
HAPPENED
THAT
CURIOUS
PEOPLE
CAME,
WHO
HAD
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THERE
WERE
TWO
WISE
MEN,
OR
SORCERERS,
OR
HOLY
MEN
LIVING
BY
THAT
FERRY.
THE
CURIOUS
PEOPLE
ASKED
MANY
QUESTIONS,
BUT
THEY
GOT
NO
ANSWERS,
AND
THEY
FOUND
NEITHER
SORCERERS
NOR
WISE
MEN,
THEY
ONLY
FOUND
TWO
FRIENDLY
LITTLE
OLD
MEN,
WHO
SEEMED
TO
BE
MUTE
AND
TO
HAVE
BECOME
A
BIT
STRANGE
AND
GAGA.
AND
THE
CURIOUS
PEOPLE
LAUGHED
AND
WERE
DISCUSSING
HOW
FOOLISHLY
AND
GULLIBLY
THE
COMMON
PEOPLE
WERE
SPREADING
SUCH
EMPTY
RUMOURS.
THE
YEARS
PASSED
BY,
AND
NOBODY
COUNTED
THEM.
THEN,
AT
ONE
TIME,
MONKS
CAME
BY
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE,
FOLLOWERS
OF
GOTAMA,
THE
BUDDHA,
WHO
WERE
ASKING
TO
BE
FERRIED
ACROSS
THE
RIVER,
AND
BY
THEM
THE
FERRYMEN
WERE
TOLD
THAT
THEY
WERE
MOST
HURRIEDLY
WALKING
BACK
TO
THEIR
GREAT
TEACHER,
FOR
THE
NEWS
HAD
SPREAD
THE
EXALTED
ONE
WAS
DEADLY
SICK
AND
WOULD
SOON
DIE
HIS
LAST
HUMAN
DEATH,
IN
ORDER
TO
BECOME
ONE
WITH
THE
SALVATION.
IT
WAS
NOT
LONG,
UNTIL
A
NEW
FLOCK
OF
MONKS
CAME
ALONG
ON
THEIR
PILGRIMAGE,
AND
ANOTHER
ONE,
AND
THE
MONKS
AS
WELL
AS
MOST
OF
THE
OTHER
TRAVELLERS
AND
PEOPLE
WALKING
THROUGH
THE
LAND
SPOKE
OF
NOTHING
ELSE
THAN
OF
GOTAMA
AND
HIS
IMPENDING
DEATH.
AND
AS
PEOPLE
ARE
FLOCKING
FROM
EVERYWHERE
AND
FROM
ALL
SIDES,
WHEN
THEY
ARE
GOING
TO
WAR
OR
TO
THE
CORONATION
OF
A
KING,
AND
ARE
GATHERING
LIKE
ANTS
IN
DROVES,
THUS
THEY
FLOCKED,
LIKE
BEING
DRAWN
ON
BY
A
MAGIC
SPELL,
TO
WHERE
THE
GREAT
BUDDHA
WAS
AWAITING
HIS
DEATH,
WHERE
THE
HUGE
EVENT
WAS
TO
TAKE
PLACE
AND
THE
GREAT
PERFECTED
ONE
OF
AN
ERA
WAS
TO
BECOME
ONE
WITH
THE
GLORY.
OFTEN,
SIDDHARTHA
THOUGHT
IN
THOSE
DAYS
OF
THE
DYING
WISE
MAN,
THE
GREAT
TEACHER,
WHOSE
VOICE
HAD
ADMONISHED
NATIONS
AND
HAD
AWOKEN
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS,
WHOSE
VOICE
HE
HAD
ALSO
ONCE
HEARD,
WHOSE
HOLY
FACE
HE
HAD
ALSO
ONCE
SEEN
WITH
RESPECT.
KINDLY,
HE
THOUGHT
OF
HIM,
SAW
HIS
PATH
TO
PERFECTION
BEFORE
HIS
EYES,
AND
REMEMBERED
WITH
A
SMILE
THOSE
WORDS
WHICH
HE
HAD
ONCE,
AS
A
YOUNG
MAN,
SAID
TO
HIM,
THE
EXALTED
ONE.
THEY
HAD
BEEN,
SO
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM,
PROUD
AND
PRECOCIOUS
WORDS;
WITH
A
SMILE,
HE
REMEMBERED
THEM.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
HE
KNEW
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
STANDING
BETWEEN
GOTAMA
AND
HIM
ANY
MORE,
THOUGH
HE
WAS
STILL
UNABLE
TO
ACCEPT
HIS
TEACHINGS.
NO,
THERE
WAS
NO
TEACHING
A
TRULY
SEARCHING
PERSON,
SOMEONE
WHO
TRULY
WANTED
TO
FIND,
COULD
ACCEPT.
BUT
HE
WHO
HAD
FOUND,
HE
COULD
APPROVE
OF
ANY
TEACHINGS,
EVERY
PATH,
EVERY
GOAL,
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
STANDING
BETWEEN
HIM
AND
ALL
THE
OTHER
THOUSAND
ANY
MORE
WHO
LIVED
IN
THAT
WHAT
IS
ETERNAL,
WHO
BREATHED
WHAT
IS
DIVINE.
ON
ONE
OF
THESE
DAYS,
WHEN
SO
MANY
WENT
ON
A
PILGRIMAGE
TO
THE
DYING
BUDDHA,
KAMALA
ALSO
WENT
TO
HIM,
WHO
USED
TO
BE
THE
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
OF
THE
COURTESANS.
A
LONG
TIME
AGO,
SHE
HAD
RETIRED
FROM
HER
PREVIOUS
LIFE,
HAD
GIVEN
HER
GARDEN
TO
THE
MONKS
OF
GOTAMA
AS
A
GIFT,
HAD
TAKEN
HER
REFUGE
IN
THE
TEACHINGS,
WAS
AMONG
THE
FRIENDS
AND
BENEFACTORS
OF
THE
PILGRIMS.
TOGETHER
WITH
SIDDHARTHA
THE
BOY,
HER
SON,
SHE
HAD
GONE
ON
HER
WAY
DUE
TO
THE
NEWS
OF
THE
NEAR
DEATH
OF
GOTAMA,
IN
SIMPLE
CLOTHES,
ON
FOOT.
WITH
HER
LITTLE
SON,
SHE
WAS
TRAVELLING
BY
THE
RIVER;
BUT
THE
BOY
HAD
SOON
GROWN
TIRED,
DESIRED
TO
GO
BACK
HOME,
DESIRED
TO
REST,
DESIRED
TO
EAT,
BECAME
DISOBEDIENT
AND
STARTED
WHINING.
KAMALA
OFTEN
HAD
TO
TAKE
A
REST
WITH
HIM,
HE
WAS
ACCUSTOMED
TO
HAVING
HIS
WAY
AGAINST
HER,
SHE
HAD
TO
FEED
HIM,
HAD
TO
COMFORT
HIM,
HAD
TO
SCOLD
HIM.
HE
DID
NOT
COMPREHEND
WHY
HE
HAD
TO
GO
ON
THIS
EXHAUSTING
AND
SAD
PILGRIMAGE
WITH
HIS
MOTHER,
TO
AN
UNKNOWN
PLACE,
TO
A
STRANGER,
WHO
WAS
HOLY
AND
ABOUT
TO
DIE.
SO
WHAT
IF
HE
DIED,
HOW
DID
THIS
CONCERN
THE
BOY?
THE
PILGRIMS
WERE
GETTING
CLOSE
TO
VASUDEVA'S
FERRY,
WHEN
LITTLE
SIDDHARTHA
ONCE
AGAIN
FORCED
HIS
MOTHER
TO
REST.
SHE,
KAMALA
HERSELF,
HAD
ALSO
BECOME
TIRED,
AND
WHILE
THE
BOY
WAS
CHEWING
A
BANANA,
SHE
CROUCHED
DOWN
ON
THE
GROUND,
CLOSED
HER
EYES
A
BIT,
AND
RESTED.
BUT
SUDDENLY,
SHE
UTTERED
A
WAILING
SCREAM,
THE
BOY
LOOKED
AT
HER
IN
FEAR
AND
SAW
HER
FACE
HAVING
GROWN
PALE
FROM
HORROR;
AND
FROM
UNDER
HER
DRESS,
A
SMALL,
BLACK
SNAKE
FLED,
BY
WHICH
KAMALA
HAD
BEEN
BITTEN.
HURRIEDLY,
THEY
NOW
BOTH
RAN
ALONG
THE
PATH,
IN
ORDER
TO
REACH
PEOPLE,
AND
GOT
NEAR
TO
THE
FERRY,
THERE
KAMALA
COLLAPSED,
AND
WAS
NOT
ABLE
TO
GO
ANY
FURTHER.
BUT
THE
BOY
STARTED
CRYING
MISERABLY,
ONLY
INTERRUPTING
IT
TO
KISS
AND
HUG
HIS
MOTHER,
AND
SHE
ALSO
JOINED
HIS
LOUD
SCREAMS
FOR
HELP,
UNTIL
THE
SOUND
REACHED
VASUDEVA'S
EARS,
WHO
STOOD
AT
THE
FERRY.
QUICKLY,
HE
CAME
WALKING,
TOOK
THE
WOMAN
ON
HIS
ARMS,
CARRIED
HER
INTO
THE
BOAT,
THE
BOY
RAN
ALONG,
AND
SOON
THEY
ALL
REACHED
THE
HUT,
WERE
SIDDHARTHA
STOOD
BY
THE
STOVE
AND
WAS
JUST
LIGHTING
THE
FIRE.
HE
LOOKED
UP
AND
FIRST
SAW
THE
BOY'S
FACE,
WHICH
WONDROUSLY
REMINDED
HIM
OF
SOMETHING,
LIKE
A
WARNING
TO
REMEMBER
SOMETHING
HE
HAD
FORGOTTEN.
THEN
HE
SAW
KAMALA,
WHOM
HE
INSTANTLY
RECOGNISED,
THOUGH
SHE
LAY
UNCONSCIOUS
IN
THE
FERRYMAN'S
ARMS,
AND
NOW
HE
KNEW
THAT
IT
WAS
HIS
OWN
SON,
WHOSE
FACE
HAD
BEEN
SUCH
A
WARNING
REMINDER
TO
HIM,
AND
THE
HEART
STIRRED
IN
HIS
CHEST.
KAMALA'S
WOUND
WAS
WASHED,
BUT
HAD
ALREADY
TURNED
BLACK
AND
HER
BODY
WAS
SWOLLEN,
SHE
WAS
MADE
TO
DRINK
A
HEALING
POTION.
HER
CONSCIOUSNESS
RETURNED,
SHE
LAY
ON
SIDDHARTHA'S
BED
IN
THE
HUT
AND
BENT
OVER
HER
STOOD
SIDDHARTHA,
WHO
USED
TO
LOVE
HER
SO
MUCH.
IT
SEEMED
LIKE
A
DREAM
TO
HER;
WITH
A
SMILE,
SHE
LOOKED
AT
HER
FRIEND'S
FACE;
JUST
SLOWLY
SHE,
REALIZED
HER
SITUATION,
REMEMBERED
THE
BITE,
CALLED
TIMIDLY
FOR
THE
BOY.
"HE'S
WITH
YOU,
DON'T
WORRY,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA.
KAMALA
LOOKED
INTO
HIS
EYES.
SHE
SPOKE
WITH
A
HEAVY
TONGUE,
PARALYSED
BY
THE
POISON.
"YOU'VE
BECOME
OLD,
MY
DEAR,"
SHE
SAID,
"YOU'VE
BECOME
GRAY.
BUT
YOU
ARE
LIKE
THE
YOUNG
SAMANA,
WHO
AT
ONE
TIME
CAME
WITHOUT
CLOTHES,
WITH
DUSTY
FEET,
TO
ME
INTO
THE
GARDEN.
YOU
ARE
MUCH
MORE
LIKE
HIM,
THAN
YOU
WERE
LIKE
HIM
AT
THAT
TIME
WHEN
YOU
HAD
LEFT
ME
AND
KAMASWAMI.
IN
THE
EYES,
YOU'RE
LIKE
HIM,
SIDDHARTHA.
ALAS,
I
HAVE
ALSO
GROWN
OLD,
OLD--COULD
YOU
STILL
RECOGNISE
ME?"
SIDDHARTHA
SMILED:
"INSTANTLY,
I
RECOGNISED
YOU,
KAMALA,
MY
DEAR."
KAMALA
POINTED
TO
HER
BOY
AND
SAID:
"DID
YOU
RECOGNISE
HIM
AS
WELL?
HE
IS
YOUR
SON."
HER
EYES
BECAME
CONFUSED
AND
FELL
SHUT.
THE
BOY
WEPT,
SIDDHARTHA
TOOK
HIM
ON
HIS
KNEES,
LET
HIM
WEEP,
PETTED
HIS
HAIR,
AND
AT
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
CHILD'S
FACE,
A
BRAHMAN
PRAYER
CAME
TO
HIS
MIND,
WHICH
HE
HAD
LEARNED
A
LONG
TIME
AGO,
WHEN
HE
HAD
BEEN
A
LITTLE
BOY
HIMSELF.
SLOWLY,
WITH
A
SINGING
VOICE,
HE
STARTED
TO
SPEAK;
FROM
HIS
PAST
AND
CHILDHOOD,
THE
WORDS
CAME
FLOWING
TO
HIM.
AND
WITH
THAT
SINGSONG,
THE
BOY
BECAME
CALM,
WAS
ONLY
NOW
AND
THEN
UTTERING
A
SOB
AND
FELL
ASLEEP.
SIDDHARTHA
PLACED
HIM
ON
VASUDEVA'S
BED.
VASUDEVA
STOOD
BY
THE
STOVE
AND
COOKED
RICE.
SIDDHARTHA
GAVE
HIM
A
LOOK,
WHICH
HE
RETURNED
WITH
A
SMILE.
"SHE'LL
DIE,"
SIDDHARTHA
SAID
QUIETLY.
VASUDEVA
NODDED;
OVER
HIS
FRIENDLY
FACE
RAN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
STOVE'S
FIRE.
ONCE
AGAIN,
KAMALA
RETURNED
TO
CONSCIOUSNESS.
PAIN
DISTORTED
HER
FACE,
SIDDHARTHA'S
EYES
READ
THE
SUFFERING
ON
HER
MOUTH,
ON
HER
PALE
CHEEKS.
QUIETLY,
HE
READ
IT,
ATTENTIVELY,
WAITING,
HIS
MIND
BECOMING
ONE
WITH
HER
SUFFERING.
KAMALA
FELT
IT,
HER
GAZE
SOUGHT
HIS
EYES.
LOOKING
AT
HIM,
SHE
SAID:
"NOW
I
SEE
THAT
YOUR
EYES
HAVE
CHANGED
AS
WELL.
THEY'VE
BECOME
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.
BY
WHAT
DO
I
STILL
RECOGNISE
THAT
YOU'RE
SIDDHARTHA?
IT'S
YOU,
AND
IT'S
NOT
YOU."
SIDDHARTHA
SAID
NOTHING,
QUIETLY
HIS
EYES
LOOKED
AT
HERS.
"YOU
HAVE
ACHIEVED
IT?"
SHE
ASKED.
"YOU
HAVE
FOUND
PEACE?"
HE
SMILED
AND
PLACED
HIS
HAND
ON
HERS.
"I'M
SEEING
IT,"
SHE
SAID,
"I'M
SEEING
IT.
I
TOO
WILL
FIND
PEACE."
"YOU
HAVE
FOUND
IT,"
SIDDHARTHA
SPOKE
IN
A
WHISPER.
KAMALA
NEVER
STOPPED
LOOKING
INTO
HIS
EYES.
SHE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
HER
PILGRIMAGE
TO
GOTAMA,
WHICH
WANTED
TO
TAKE,
IN
ORDER
TO
SEE
THE
FACE
OF
THE
PERFECTED
ONE,
TO
BREATHE
HIS
PEACE,
AND
SHE
THOUGHT
THAT
SHE
HAD
NOW
FOUND
HIM
IN
HIS
PLACE,
AND
THAT
IT
WAS
GOOD,
JUST
AS
GOOD,
AS
IF
SHE
HAD
SEEN
THE
OTHER
ONE.
SHE
WANTED
TO
TELL
THIS
TO
HIM,
BUT
THE
TONGUE
NO
LONGER
OBEYED
HER
WILL.
WITHOUT
SPEAKING,
SHE
LOOKED
AT
HIM,
AND
HE
SAW
THE
LIFE
FADING
FROM
HER
EYES.
WHEN
THE
FINAL
PAIN
FILLED
HER
EYES
AND
MADE
THEM
GROW
DIM,
WHEN
THE
FINAL
SHIVER
RAN
THROUGH
HER
LIMBS,
HIS
FINGER
CLOSED
HER
EYELIDS.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
SAT
AND
LOOKED
AT
HER
PEACEFULLY
DEAD
FACE.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
OBSERVED
HER
MOUTH,
HER
OLD,
TIRED
MOUTH,
WITH
THOSE
LIPS,
WHICH
HAD
BECOME
THIN,
AND
HE
REMEMBERED,
THAT
HE
USED
TO,
IN
THE
SPRING
OF
HIS
YEARS,
COMPARE
THIS
MOUTH
WITH
A
FRESHLY
CRACKED
FIG.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
SAT,
READ
IN
THE
PALE
FACE,
IN
THE
TIRED
WRINKLES,
FILLED
HIMSELF
WITH
THIS
SIGHT,
SAW
HIS
OWN
FACE
LYING
IN
THE
SAME
MANNER,
JUST
AS
WHITE,
JUST
AS
QUENCHED
OUT,
AND
SAW
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
HIS
FACE
AND
HERS
BEING
YOUNG,
WITH
RED
LIPS,
WITH
FIERY
EYES,
AND
THE
FEELING
OF
THIS
BOTH
BEING
PRESENT
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
REAL,
THE
FEELING
OF
ETERNITY,
COMPLETELY
FILLED
EVERY
ASPECT
OF
HIS
BEING.
DEEPLY
HE
FELT,
MORE
DEEPLY
THAN
EVER
BEFORE,
IN
THIS
HOUR,
THE
INDESTRUCTIBILITY
OF
EVERY
LIFE,
THE
ETERNITY
OF
EVERY
MOMENT.
WHEN
HE
ROSE,
VASUDEVA
HAD
PREPARED
RICE
FOR
HIM.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
DID
NOT
EAT.
IN
THE
STABLE,
WHERE
THEIR
GOAT
STOOD,
THE
TWO
OLD
MEN
PREPARED
BEDS
OF
STRAW
FOR
THEMSELVES,
AND
VASUDEVA
LAY
HIMSELF
DOWN
TO
SLEEP.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
WENT
OUTSIDE
AND
SAT
THIS
NIGHT
BEFORE
THE
HUT,
LISTENING
TO
THE
RIVER,
SURROUNDED
BY
THE
PAST,
TOUCHED
AND
ENCIRCLED
BY
ALL
TIMES
OF
HIS
LIFE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME.
BUT
OCCASIONALLY,
HE
ROSE,
STEPPED
TO
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
HUT
AND
LISTENED,
WHETHER
THE
BOY
WAS
SLEEPING.
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING,
EVEN
BEFORE
THE
SUN
COULD
BE
SEEN,
VASUDEVA
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
STABLE
AND
WALKED
OVER
TO
HIS
FRIEND.
"YOU
HAVEN'T
SLEPT,"
HE
SAID.
"NO,
VASUDEVA.
I
SAT
HERE,
I
WAS
LISTENING
TO
THE
RIVER.
A
LOT
IT
HAS
TOLD
ME,
DEEPLY
IT
HAS
FILLED
ME
WITH
THE
HEALING
THOUGHT,
WITH
THE
THOUGHT
OF
ONENESS."
"YOU'VE
EXPERIENCED
SUFFERING,
SIDDHARTHA,
BUT
I
SEE:
NO
SADNESS
HAS
ENTERED
YOUR
HEART."
"NO,
MY
DEAR,
HOW
SHOULD
I
BE
SAD?
I,
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
RICH
AND
HAPPY,
HAVE
BECOME
EVEN
RICHER
AND
HAPPIER
NOW.
MY
SON
HAS
BEEN
GIVEN
TO
ME."
"YOUR
SON
SHALL
BE
WELCOME
TO
ME
AS
WELL.
BUT
NOW,
SIDDHARTHA,
LET'S
GET
TO
WORK,
THERE
IS
MUCH
TO
BE
DONE.
KAMALA
HAS
DIED
ON
THE
SAME
BED,
ON
WHICH
MY
WIFE
HAD
DIED
A
LONG
TIME
AGO.
LET
US
ALSO
BUILD
KAMALA'S
FUNERAL
PILE
ON
THE
SAME
HILL
ON
WHICH
I
HAD
THEN
BUILT
MY
WIFE'S
FUNERAL
PILE."
WHILE
THE
BOY
WAS
STILL
ASLEEP,
THEY
BUILT
THE
FUNERAL
PILE.
THE
SON
TIMID
AND
WEEPING,
THE
BOY
HAD
ATTENDED
HIS
MOTHER'S
FUNERAL;
GLOOMY
AND
SHY,
HE
HAD
LISTENED
TO
SIDDHARTHA,
WHO
GREETED
HIM
AS
HIS
SON
AND
WELCOMED
HIM
AT
HIS
PLACE
IN
VASUDEVA'S
HUT.
PALE,
HE
SAT
FOR
MANY
DAYS
BY
THE
HILL
OF
THE
DEAD,
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
EAT,
GAVE
NO
OPEN
LOOK,
DID
NOT
OPEN
HIS
HEART,
MET
HIS
FATE
WITH
RESISTANCE
AND
DENIAL.
SIDDHARTHA
SPARED
HIM
AND
LET
HIM
DO
AS
HE
PLEASED,
HE
HONOURED
HIS
MOURNING.
SIDDHARTHA
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
HIS
SON
DID
NOT
KNOW
HIM,
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
LOVE
HIM
LIKE
A
FATHER.
SLOWLY,
HE
ALSO
SAW
AND
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
THE
ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD
WAS
A
PAMPERED
BOY,
A
MOTHER'S
BOY,
AND
THAT
HE
HAD
GROWN
UP
IN
THE
HABITS
OF
RICH
PEOPLE,
ACCUSTOMED
TO
FINER
FOOD,
TO
A
SOFT
BED,
ACCUSTOMED
TO
GIVING
ORDERS
TO
SERVANTS.
SIDDHARTHA
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
THE
MOURNING,
PAMPERED
CHILD
COULD
NOT
SUDDENLY
AND
WILLINGLY
BE
CONTENT
WITH
A
LIFE
AMONG
STRANGERS
AND
IN
POVERTY.
HE
DID
NOT
FORCE
HIM,
HE
DID
MANY
A
CHORE
FOR
HIM,
ALWAYS
PICKED
THE
BEST
PIECE
OF
THE
MEAL
FOR
HIM.
SLOWLY,
HE
HOPED
TO
WIN
HIM
OVER,
BY
FRIENDLY
PATIENCE.
RICH
AND
HAPPY,
HE
HAD
CALLED
HIMSELF,
WHEN
THE
BOY
HAD
COME
TO
HIM.
SINCE
TIME
HAD
PASSED
ON
IN
THE
MEANTIME,
AND
THE
BOY
REMAINED
A
STRANGER
AND
IN
A
GLOOMY
DISPOSITION,
SINCE
HE
DISPLAYED
A
PROUD
AND
STUBBORNLY
DISOBEDIENT
HEART,
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
DO
ANY
WORK,
DID
NOT
PAY
HIS
RESPECT
TO
THE
OLD
MEN,
STOLE
FROM
VASUDEVA'S
FRUIT-TREES,
THEN
SIDDHARTHA
BEGAN
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
HIS
SON
HAD
NOT
BROUGHT
HIM
HAPPINESS
AND
PEACE,
BUT
SUFFERING
AND
WORRY.
BUT
HE
LOVED
HIM,
AND
HE
PREFERRED
THE
SUFFERING
AND
WORRIES
OF
LOVE
OVER
HAPPINESS
AND
JOY
WITHOUT
THE
BOY.
SINCE
YOUNG
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
IN
THE
HUT,
THE
OLD
MEN
HAD
SPLIT
THE
WORK.
VASUDEVA
HAD
AGAIN
TAKEN
ON
THE
JOB
OF
THE
FERRYMAN
ALL
BY
HIMSELF,
AND
SIDDHARTHA,
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
WITH
HIS
SON,
DID
THE
WORK
IN
THE
HUT
AND
THE
FIELD.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
FOR
LONG
MONTHS,
SIDDHARTHA
WAITED
FOR
HIS
SON
TO
UNDERSTAND
HIM,
TO
ACCEPT
HIS
LOVE,
TO
PERHAPS
RECIPROCATE
IT.
FOR
LONG
MONTHS,
VASUDEVA
WAITED,
WATCHING,
WAITED
AND
SAID
NOTHING.
ONE
DAY,
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
THE
YOUNGER
HAD
ONCE
AGAIN
TORMENTED
HIS
FATHER
VERY
MUCH
WITH
SPITE
AND
AN
UNSTEADINESS
IN
HIS
WISHES
AND
HAD
BROKEN
BOTH
OF
HIS
RICE-BOWLS,
VASUDEVA
TOOK
IN
THE
EVENING
HIS
FRIEND
ASIDE
AND
TALKED
TO
HIM.
"PARDON
ME."
HE
SAID,
"FROM
A
FRIENDLY
HEART,
I'M
TALKING
TO
YOU.
I'M
SEEING
THAT
YOU
ARE
TORMENTING
YOURSELF,
I'M
SEEING
THAT
YOU'RE
IN
GRIEF.
YOUR
SON,
MY
DEAR,
IS
WORRYING
YOU,
AND
HE
IS
ALSO
WORRYING
ME.
THAT
YOUNG
BIRD
IS
ACCUSTOMED
TO
A
DIFFERENT
LIFE,
TO
A
DIFFERENT
NEST.
HE
HAS
NOT,
LIKE
YOU,
RAN
AWAY
FROM
RICHES
AND
THE
CITY,
BEING
DISGUSTED
AND
FED
UP
WITH
IT;
AGAINST
HIS
WILL,
HE
HAD
TO
LEAVE
ALL
THIS
BEHIND.
I
ASKED
THE
RIVER,
OH
FRIEND,
MANY
TIMES
I
HAVE
ASKED
IT.
BUT
THE
RIVER
LAUGHS,
IT
LAUGHS
AT
ME,
IT
LAUGHS
AT
YOU
AND
ME,
AND
IS
SHAKING
WITH
LAUGHTER
AT
OUT
FOOLISHNESS.
WATER
WANTS
TO
JOIN
WATER,
YOUTH
WANTS
TO
JOIN
YOUTH,
YOUR
SON
IS
NOT
IN
THE
PLACE
WHERE
HE
CAN
PROSPER.
YOU
TOO
SHOULD
ASK
THE
RIVER;
YOU
TOO
SHOULD
LISTEN
TO
IT!"
TROUBLED,
SIDDHARTHA
LOOKED
INTO
HIS
FRIENDLY
FACE,
IN
THE
MANY
WRINKLES
OF
WHICH
THERE
WAS
INCESSANT
CHEERFULNESS.
"HOW
COULD
I
PART
WITH
HIM?"
HE
SAID
QUIETLY,
ASHAMED.
"GIVE
ME
SOME
MORE
TIME,
MY
DEAR!
SEE,
I'M
FIGHTING
FOR
HIM,
I'M
SEEKING
TO
WIN
HIS
HEART,
WITH
LOVE
AND
WITH
FRIENDLY
PATIENCE
I
INTENT
TO
CAPTURE
IT.
ONE
DAY,
THE
RIVER
SHALL
ALSO
TALK
TO
HIM,
HE
ALSO
IS
CALLED
UPON."
VASUDEVA'S
SMILE
FLOURISHED
MORE
WARMLY.
"OH
YES,
HE
TOO
IS
CALLED
UPON,
HE
TOO
IS
OF
THE
ETERNAL
LIFE.
BUT
DO
WE,
YOU
AND
ME,
KNOW
WHAT
HE
IS
CALLED
UPON
TO
DO,
WHAT
PATH
TO
TAKE,
WHAT
ACTIONS
TO
PERFORM,
WHAT
PAIN
TO
ENDURE?
NOT
A
SMALL
ONE,
HIS
PAIN
WILL
BE;
AFTER
ALL,
HIS
HEART
IS
PROUD
AND
HARD,
PEOPLE
LIKE
THIS
HAVE
TO
SUFFER
A
LOT,
ERR
A
LOT,
DO
MUCH
INJUSTICE,
BURDEN
THEMSELVES
WITH
MUCH
SIN.
TELL
ME,
MY
DEAR:
YOU'RE
NOT
TAKING
CONTROL
OF
YOUR
SON'S
UPBRINGING?
YOU
DON'T
FORCE
HIM?
YOU
DON'T
BEAT
HIM?
YOU
DON'T
PUNISH
HIM?"
"NO,
VASUDEVA,
I
DON'T
DO
ANYTHING
OF
THIS."
"I
KNEW
IT.
YOU
DON'T
FORCE
HIM,
DON'T
BEAT
HIM,
DON'T
GIVE
HIM
ORDERS,
BECAUSE
YOU
KNOW
THAT
'SOFT'
IS
STRONGER
THAN
'HARD',
WATER
STRONGER
THAN
ROCKS,
LOVE
STRONGER
THAN
FORCE.
VERY
GOOD,
I
PRAISE
YOU.
BUT
AREN'T
YOU
MISTAKEN
IN
THINKING
THAT
YOU
WOULDN'T
FORCE
HIM,
WOULDN'T
PUNISH
HIM?
DON'T
YOU
SHACKLE
HIM
WITH
YOUR
LOVE?
DON'T
YOU
MAKE
HIM
FEEL
INFERIOR
EVERY
DAY,
AND
DON'T
YOU
MAKE
IT
EVEN
HARDER
ON
HIM
WITH
YOUR
KINDNESS
AND
PATIENCE?
DON'T
YOU
FORCE
HIM,
THE
ARROGANT
AND
PAMPERED
BOY,
TO
LIVE
IN
A
HUT
WITH
TWO
OLD
BANANA-EATERS,
TO
WHOM
EVEN
RICE
IS
A
DELICACY,
WHOSE
THOUGHTS
CAN'T
BE
HIS,
WHOSE
HEARTS
ARE
OLD
AND
QUIET
AND
BEATS
IN
A
DIFFERENT
PACE
THAN
HIS?
ISN'T
FORCED,
ISN'T
HE
PUNISHED
BY
ALL
THIS?"
TROUBLED,
SIDDHARTHA
LOOKED
TO
THE
GROUND.
QUIETLY,
HE
ASKED:
"WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
SHOULD
I
DO?"
QUOTH
VASUDEVA:
"BRING
HIM
INTO
THE
CITY,
BRING
HIM
INTO
HIS
MOTHER'S
HOUSE,
THERE'LL
STILL
BE
SERVANTS
AROUND,
GIVE
HIM
TO
THEM.
AND
WHEN
THERE
AREN'T
ANY
AROUND
ANY
MORE,
BRING
HIM
TO
A
TEACHER,
NOT
FOR
THE
TEACHINGS'
SAKE,
BUT
SO
THAT
HE
SHALL
BE
AMONG
OTHER
BOYS,
AND
AMONG
GIRLS,
AND
IN
THE
WORLD
WHICH
IS
HIS
OWN.
HAVE
YOU
NEVER
THOUGHT
OF
THIS?"
"YOU'RE
SEEING
INTO
MY
HEART,"
SIDDHARTHA
SPOKE
SADLY.
"OFTEN,
I
HAVE
THOUGHT
OF
THIS.
BUT
LOOK,
HOW
SHALL
I
PUT
HIM,
WHO
HAD
NO
TENDER
HEART
ANYHOW,
INTO
THIS
WORLD?
WON'T
HE
BECOME
EXUBERANT,
WON'T
HE
LOSE
HIMSELF
TO
PLEASURE
AND
POWER,
WON'T
HE
REPEAT
ALL
OF
HIS
FATHER'S
MISTAKES,
WON'T
HE
PERHAPS
GET
ENTIRELY
LOST
IN
SANSARA?"
BRIGHTLY,
THE
FERRYMAN'S
SMILE
LIT
UP;
SOFTLY,
HE
TOUCHED
SIDDHARTHA'S
ARM
AND
SAID:
"ASK
THE
RIVER
ABOUT
IT,
MY
FRIEND!
HEAR
IT
LAUGH
ABOUT
IT!
WOULD
YOU
ACTUALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
HAD
COMMITTED
YOUR
FOOLISH
ACTS
IN
ORDER
TO
SPARE
YOUR
SON
FROM
COMMITTING
THEM
TOO?
AND
COULD
YOU
IN
ANY
WAY
PROTECT
YOUR
SON
FROM
SANSARA?
HOW
COULD
YOU?
BY
MEANS
OF
TEACHINGS,
PRAYER,
ADMONITION?
MY
DEAR,
HAVE
YOU
ENTIRELY
FORGOTTEN
THAT
STORY,
THAT
STORY
CONTAINING
SO
MANY
LESSONS,
THAT
STORY
ABOUT
SIDDHARTHA,
A
BRAHMAN'S
SON,
WHICH
YOU
ONCE
TOLD
ME
HERE
ON
THIS
VERY
SPOT?
WHO
HAS
KEPT
THE
SAMANA
SIDDHARTHA
SAFE
FROM
SANSARA,
FROM
SIN,
FROM
GREED,
FROM
FOOLISHNESS?
WERE
HIS
FATHER'S
RELIGIOUS
DEVOTION,
HIS
TEACHERS
WARNINGS,
HIS
OWN
KNOWLEDGE,
HIS
OWN
SEARCH
ABLE
TO
KEEP
HIM
SAFE?
WHICH
FATHER,
WHICH
TEACHER
HAD
BEEN
ABLE
TO
PROTECT
HIM
FROM
LIVING
HIS
LIFE
FOR
HIMSELF,
FROM
SOILING
HIMSELF
WITH
LIFE,
FROM
BURDENING
HIMSELF
WITH
GUILT,
FROM
DRINKING
THE
BITTER
DRINK
FOR
HIMSELF,
FROM
FINDING
HIS
PATH
FOR
HIMSELF?
WOULD
YOU
THINK,
MY
DEAR,
ANYBODY
MIGHT
PERHAPS
BE
SPARED
FROM
TAKING
THIS
PATH?
THAT
PERHAPS
YOUR
LITTLE
SON
WOULD
BE
SPARED,
BECAUSE
YOU
LOVE
HIM,
BECAUSE
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KEEP
HIM
FROM
SUFFERING
AND
PAIN
AND
DISAPPOINTMENT?
BUT
EVEN
IF
YOU
WOULD
DIE
TEN
TIMES
FOR
HIM,
YOU
WOULD
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
TAKE
THE
SLIGHTEST
PART
OF
HIS
DESTINY
UPON
YOURSELF."
NEVER
BEFORE,
VASUDEVA
HAD
SPOKEN
SO
MANY
WORDS.
KINDLY,
SIDDHARTHA
THANKED
HIM,
WENT
TROUBLED
INTO
THE
HUT,
COULD
NOT
SLEEP
FOR
A
LONG
TIME.
VASUDEVA
HAD
TOLD
HIM
NOTHING,
HE
HAD
NOT
ALREADY
THOUGHT
AND
KNOWN
FOR
HIMSELF.
BUT
THIS
WAS
A
KNOWLEDGE
HE
COULD
NOT
ACT
UPON,
STRONGER
THAN
THE
KNOWLEDGE
WAS
HIS
LOVE
FOR
THE
BOY,
STRONGER
WAS
HIS
TENDERNESS,
HIS
FEAR
TO
LOSE
HIM.
HAD
HE
EVER
LOST
HIS
HEART
SO
MUCH
TO
SOMETHING,
HAD
HE
EVER
LOVED
ANY
PERSON
THUS,
THUS
BLINDLY,
THUS
SUFFERINGLY,
THUS
UNSUCCESSFULLY,
AND
YET
THUS
HAPPILY?
SIDDHARTHA
COULD
NOT
HEED
HIS
FRIEND'S
ADVICE,
HE
COULD
NOT
GIVE
UP
THE
BOY.
HE
LET
THE
BOY
GIVE
HIM
ORDERS,
HE
LET
HIM
DISREGARD
HIM.
HE
SAID
NOTHING
AND
WAITED;
DAILY,
HE
BEGAN
THE
MUTE
STRUGGLE
OF
FRIENDLINESS,
THE
SILENT
WAR
OF
PATIENCE.
VASUDEVA
ALSO
SAID
NOTHING
AND
WAITED,
FRIENDLY,
KNOWING,
PATIENT.
THEY
WERE
BOTH
MASTERS
OF
PATIENCE.
AT
ONE
TIME,
WHEN
THE
BOY'S
FACE
REMINDED
HIM
VERY
MUCH
OF
KAMALA,
SIDDHARTHA
SUDDENLY
HAD
TO
THINK
OF
A
LINE
WHICH
KAMALA
A
LONG
TIME
AGO,
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
THEIR
YOUTH,
HAD
ONCE
SAID
TO
HIM.
"YOU
CANNOT
LOVE,"
SHE
HAD
SAID
TO
HIM,
AND
HE
HAD
AGREED
WITH
HER
AND
HAD
COMPARED
HIMSELF
WITH
A
STAR,
WHILE
COMPARING
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE
WITH
FALLING
LEAVES,
AND
NEVERTHELESS
HE
HAD
ALSO
SENSED
AN
ACCUSATION
IN
THAT
LINE.
INDEED,
HE
HAD
NEVER
BEEN
ABLE
TO
LOSE
OR
DEVOTE
HIMSELF
COMPLETELY
TO
ANOTHER
PERSON,
TO
FORGET
HIMSELF,
TO
COMMIT
FOOLISH
ACTS
FOR
THE
LOVE
OF
ANOTHER
PERSON;
NEVER
HE
HAD
BEEN
ABLE
TO
DO
THIS,
AND
THIS
WAS,
AS
IT
HAD
SEEMED
TO
HIM
AT
THAT
TIME,
THE
GREAT
DISTINCTION
WHICH
SET
HIM
APART
FROM
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE.
BUT
NOW,
SINCE
HIS
SON
WAS
HERE,
NOW
HE,
SIDDHARTHA,
HAD
ALSO
BECOME
COMPLETELY
A
CHILDLIKE
PERSON,
SUFFERING
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ANOTHER
PERSON,
LOVING
ANOTHER
PERSON,
LOST
TO
A
LOVE,
HAVING
BECOME
A
FOOL
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
LOVE.
NOW
HE
TOO
FELT,
LATE,
ONCE
IN
HIS
LIFETIME,
THIS
STRONGEST
AND
STRANGEST
OF
ALL
PASSIONS,
SUFFERED
FROM
IT,
SUFFERED
MISERABLY,
AND
WAS
NEVERTHELESS
IN
BLISS,
WAS
NEVERTHELESS
RENEWED
IN
ONE
RESPECT,
ENRICHED
BY
ONE
THING.
HE
DID
SENSE
VERY
WELL
THAT
THIS
LOVE,
THIS
BLIND
LOVE
FOR
HIS
SON,
WAS
A
PASSION,
SOMETHING
VERY
HUMAN,
THAT
IT
WAS
SANSARA,
A
MURKY
SOURCE,
DARK
WATERS.
NEVERTHELESS,
HE
FELT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME,
IT
WAS
NOT
WORTHLESS,
IT
WAS
NECESSARY,
CAME
FROM
THE
ESSENCE
OF
HIS
OWN
BEING.
THIS
PLEASURE
ALSO
HAD
TO
BE
ATONED
FOR,
THIS
PAIN
ALSO
HAD
TO
BE
ENDURED,
THESE
FOOLISH
ACTS
ALSO
HAD
TO
BE
COMMITTED.
THROUGH
ALL
THIS,
THE
SON
LET
HIM
COMMIT
HIS
FOOLISH
ACTS,
LET
HIM
COURT
FOR
HIS
AFFECTION,
LET
HIM
HUMILIATE
HIMSELF
EVERY
DAY
BY
GIVING
IN
TO
HIS
MOODS.
THIS
FATHER
HAD
NOTHING
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
DELIGHTED
HIM
AND
NOTHING
WHICH
HE
WOULD
HAVE
FEARED.
HE
WAS
A
GOOD
MAN,
THIS
FATHER,
A
GOOD,
KIND,
SOFT
MAN,
PERHAPS
A
VERY
DEVOUT
MAN,
PERHAPS
A
SAINT,
ALL
THESE
THERE
NO
ATTRIBUTES
WHICH
COULD
WIN
THE
BOY
OVER.
HE
WAS
BORED
BY
THIS
FATHER,
WHO
KEPT
HIM
PRISONER
HERE
IN
THIS
MISERABLE
HUT
OF
HIS,
HE
WAS
BORED
BY
HIM,
AND
FOR
HIM
TO
ANSWER
EVERY
NAUGHTINESS
WITH
A
SMILE,
EVERY
INSULT
WITH
FRIENDLINESS,
EVERY
VICIOUSNESS
WITH
KINDNESS,
THIS
VERY
THING
WAS
THE
HATED
TRICK
OF
THIS
OLD
SNEAK.
MUCH
MORE
THE
BOY
WOULD
HAVE
LIKED
IT
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
THREATENED
BY
HIM,
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
ABUSED
BY
HIM.
A
DAY
CAME,
WHEN
WHAT
YOUNG
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
ON
HIS
MIND
CAME
BURSTING
FORTH,
AND
HE
OPENLY
TURNED
AGAINST
HIS
FATHER.
THE
LATTER
HAD
GIVEN
HIM
A
TASK,
HE
HAD
TOLD
HIM
TO
GATHER
BRUSHWOOD.
BUT
THE
BOY
DID
NOT
LEAVE
THE
HUT,
IN
STUBBORN
DISOBEDIENCE
AND
RAGE
HE
STAYED
WHERE
HE
WAS,
THUMPED
ON
THE
GROUND
WITH
HIS
FEET,
CLENCHED
HIS
FISTS,
AND
SCREAMED
IN
A
POWERFUL
OUTBURST
HIS
HATRED
AND
CONTEMPT
INTO
HIS
FATHER'S
FACE.
"GET
THE
BRUSHWOOD
FOR
YOURSELF!"
HE
SHOUTED
FOAMING
AT
THE
MOUTH,
"I'M
NOT
YOUR
SERVANT.
I
DO
KNOW,
THAT
YOU
WON'T
HIT
ME,
YOU
DON'T
DARE;
I
DO
KNOW,
THAT
YOU
CONSTANTLY
WANT
TO
PUNISH
ME
AND
PUT
ME
DOWN
WITH
YOUR
RELIGIOUS
DEVOTION
AND
YOUR
INDULGENCE.
YOU
WANT
ME
TO
BECOME
LIKE
YOU,
JUST
AS
DEVOUT,
JUST
AS
SOFT,
JUST
AS
WISE!
BUT
I,
LISTEN
UP,
JUST
TO
MAKE
YOU
SUFFER,
I
RATHER
WANT
TO
BECOME
A
HIGHWAY-ROBBER
AND
MURDERER,
AND
GO
TO
HELL,
THAN
TO
BECOME
LIKE
YOU!
I
HATE
YOU,
YOU'RE
NOT
MY
FATHER,
AND
IF
YOU'VE
TEN
TIMES
BEEN
MY
MOTHER'S
FORNICATOR!"
RAGE
AND
GRIEF
BOILED
OVER
IN
HIM,
FOAMED
AT
THE
FATHER
IN
A
HUNDRED
SAVAGE
AND
EVIL
WORDS.
THEN
THE
BOY
RAN
AWAY
AND
ONLY
RETURNED
LATE
AT
NIGHT.
BUT
THE
NEXT
MORNING,
HE
HAD
DISAPPEARED.
WHAT
HAD
ALSO
DISAPPEARED
WAS
A
SMALL
BASKET,
WOVEN
OUT
OF
BAST
OF
TWO
COLOURS,
IN
WHICH
THE
FERRYMEN
KEPT
THOSE
COPPER
AND
SILVER
COINS
WHICH
THEY
RECEIVED
AS
A
FARE.
THE
BOAT
HAD
ALSO
DISAPPEARED,
SIDDHARTHA
SAW
IT
LYING
BY
THE
OPPOSITE
BANK.
THE
BOY
HAD
RAN
AWAY.
"I
MUST
FOLLOW
HIM,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA,
WHO
HAD
BEEN
SHIVERING
WITH
GRIEF
SINCE
THOSE
RANTING
SPEECHES,
THE
BOY
HAD
MADE
YESTERDAY.
"A
CHILD
CAN'T
GO
THROUGH
THE
FOREST
ALL
ALONE.
HE'LL
PERISH.
WE
MUST
BUILD
A
RAFT,
VASUDEVA,
TO
GET
OVER
THE
WATER."
"WE
WILL
BUILD
A
RAFT,"
SAID
VASUDEVA,
"TO
GET
OUR
BOAT
BACK,
WHICH
THE
BOY
HAS
TAKEN
AWAY.
BUT
HIM,
YOU
SHALL
LET
RUN
ALONG,
MY
FRIEND,
HE
IS
NO
CHILD
ANY
MORE,
HE
KNOWS
HOW
TO
GET
AROUND.
HE'S
LOOKING
FOR
THE
PATH
TO
THE
CITY,
AND
HE
IS
RIGHT,
DON'T
FORGET
THAT.
HE'S
DOING
WHAT
YOU'VE
FAILED
TO
DO
YOURSELF.
HE'S
TAKING
CARE
OF
HIMSELF,
HE'S
TAKING
HIS
COURSE.
ALAS,
SIDDHARTHA,
I
SEE
YOU
SUFFERING,
BUT
YOU'RE
SUFFERING
A
PAIN
AT
WHICH
ONE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
LAUGH,
AT
WHICH
YOU'LL
SOON
LAUGH
FOR
YOURSELF."
SIDDHARTHA
DID
NOT
ANSWER.
HE
ALREADY
HELD
THE
AXE
IN
HIS
HANDS
AND
BEGAN
TO
MAKE
A
RAFT
OF
BAMBOO,
AND
VASUDEVA
HELPED
HIM
TO
TIED
THE
CANES
TOGETHER
WITH
ROPES
OF
GRASS.
THEN
THEY
CROSSED
OVER,
DRIFTED
FAR
OFF
THEIR
COURSE,
PULLED
THE
RAFT
UPRIVER
ON
THE
OPPOSITE
BANK.
"WHY
DID
YOU
TAKE
THE
AXE
ALONG?"
ASKED
SIDDHARTHA.
VASUDEVA
SAID:
"IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
OAR
OF
OUR
BOAT
GOT
LOST."
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
KNEW
WHAT
HIS
FRIEND
WAS
THINKING.
HE
THOUGHT,
THE
BOY
WOULD
HAVE
THROWN
AWAY
OR
BROKEN
THE
OAR
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
EVEN
AND
IN
ORDER
TO
KEEP
THEM
FROM
FOLLOWING
HIM.
AND
IN
FACT,
THERE
WAS
NO
OAR
LEFT
IN
THE
BOAT.
VASUDEVA
POINTED
TO
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
BOAT
AND
LOOKED
AT
HIS
FRIEND
WITH
A
SMILE,
AS
IF
HE
WANTED
TO
SAY:
"DON'T
YOU
SEE
WHAT
YOUR
SON
IS
TRYING
TO
TELL
YOU?
DON'T
YOU
SEE
THAT
HE
DOESN'T
WANT
TO
BE
FOLLOWED?"
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
SAY
THIS
IN
WORDS.
HE
STARTED
MAKING
A
NEW
OAR.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
BID
HIS
FAREWELL,
TO
LOOK
FOR
THE
RUN-AWAY.
VASUDEVA
DID
NOT
STOP
HIM.
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
WALKING
THROUGH
THE
FOREST
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
THE
THOUGHT
OCCURRED
TO
HIM
THAT
HIS
SEARCH
WAS
USELESS.
EITHER,
SO
HE
THOUGHT,
THE
BOY
WAS
FAR
AHEAD
AND
HAD
ALREADY
REACHED
THE
CITY,
OR,
IF
HE
SHOULD
STILL
BE
ON
HIS
WAY,
HE
WOULD
CONCEAL
HIMSELF
FROM
HIM,
THE
PURSUER.
AS
HE
CONTINUED
THINKING,
HE
ALSO
FOUND
THAT
HE,
ON
HIS
PART,
WAS
NOT
WORRIED
FOR
HIS
SON,
THAT
HE
KNEW
DEEP
INSIDE
THAT
HE
HAD
NEITHER
PERISHED
NOR
WAS
IN
ANY
DANGER
IN
THE
FOREST.
NEVERTHELESS,
HE
RAN
WITHOUT
STOPPING,
NO
LONGER
TO
SAVE
HIM,
JUST
TO
SATISFY
HIS
DESIRE,
JUST
TO
PERHAPS
SEE
HIM
ONE
MORE
TIME.
AND
HE
RAN
UP
TO
JUST
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
CITY.
WHEN,
NEAR
THE
CITY,
HE
REACHED
A
WIDE
ROAD,
HE
STOPPED,
BY
THE
ENTRANCE
OF
THE
BEAUTIFUL
PLEASURE-GARDEN,
WHICH
USED
TO
BELONG
TO
KAMALA,
WHERE
HE
HAD
SEEN
HER
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
HER
SEDAN-CHAIR.
THE
PAST
ROSE
UP
IN
HIS
SOUL,
AGAIN
HE
SAW
HIMSELF
STANDING
THERE,
YOUNG,
A
BEARDED,
NAKED
SAMANA,
THE
HAIR
FULL
OF
DUST.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
SIDDHARTHA
STOOD
THERE
AND
LOOKED
THROUGH
THE
OPEN
GATE
INTO
THE
GARDEN,
SEEING
MONKS
IN
YELLOW
ROBES
WALKING
AMONG
THE
BEAUTIFUL
TREES.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
STOOD
THERE,
PONDERING,
SEEING
IMAGES,
LISTENING
TO
THE
STORY
OF
HIS
LIFE.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HE
STOOD
THERE,
LOOKED
AT
THE
MONKS,
SAW
YOUNG
SIDDHARTHA
IN
THEIR
PLACE,
SAW
YOUNG
KAMALA
WALKING
AMONG
THE
HIGH
TREES.
CLEARLY,
HE
SAW
HIMSELF
BEING
SERVED
FOOD
AND
DRINK
BY
KAMALA,
RECEIVING
HIS
FIRST
KISS
FROM
HER,
LOOKING
PROUDLY
AND
DISDAINFULLY
BACK
ON
HIS
BRAHMANISM,
BEGINNING
PROUDLY
AND
FULL
OF
DESIRE
HIS
WORLDLY
LIFE.
HE
SAW
KAMASWAMI,
SAW
THE
SERVANTS,
THE
ORGIES,
THE
GAMBLERS
WITH
THE
DICE,
THE
MUSICIANS,
SAW
KAMALA'S
SONG-BIRD
IN
THE
CAGE,
LIVED
THROUGH
ALL
THIS
ONCE
AGAIN,
BREATHED
SANSARA,
WAS
ONCE
AGAIN
OLD
AND
TIRED,
FELT
ONCE
AGAIN
DISGUST,
FELT
ONCE
AGAIN
THE
WISH
TO
ANNIHILATE
HIMSELF,
WAS
ONCE
AGAIN
HEALED
BY
THE
HOLY
OM.
AFTER
HAVING
BEEN
STANDING
BY
THE
GATE
OF
THE
GARDEN
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
SIDDHARTHA
REALISED
THAT
HIS
DESIRE
WAS
FOOLISH,
WHICH
HAD
MADE
HIM
GO
UP
TO
THIS
PLACE,
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
HELP
HIS
SON,
THAT
HE
WAS
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
CLING
HIM.
DEEPLY,
HE
FELT
THE
LOVE
FOR
THE
RUN-AWAY
IN
HIS
HEART,
LIKE
A
WOUND,
AND
HE
FELT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THAT
THIS
WOUND
HAD
NOT
BEEN
GIVEN
TO
HIM
IN
ORDER
TO
TURN
THE
KNIFE
IN
IT,
THAT
IT
HAD
TO
BECOME
A
BLOSSOM
AND
HAD
TO
SHINE.
THAT
THIS
WOUND
DID
NOT
BLOSSOM
YET,
DID
NOT
SHINE
YET,
AT
THIS
HOUR,
MADE
HIM
SAD.
INSTEAD
OF
THE
DESIRED
GOAL,
WHICH
HAD
DRAWN
HIM
HERE
FOLLOWING
THE
RUNAWAY
SON,
THERE
WAS
NOW
EMPTINESS.
SADLY,
HE
SAT
DOWN,
FELT
SOMETHING
DYING
IN
HIS
HEART,
EXPERIENCED
EMPTINESS,
SAW
NO
JOY
ANY
MORE,
NO
GOAL.
HE
SAT
LOST
IN
THOUGHT
AND
WAITED.
THIS
HE
HAD
LEARNED
BY
THE
RIVER,
THIS
ONE
THING:
WAITING,
HAVING
PATIENCE,
LISTENING
ATTENTIVELY.
AND
HE
SAT
AND
LISTENED,
IN
THE
DUST
OF
THE
ROAD,
LISTENED
TO
HIS
HEART,
BEATING
TIREDLY
AND
SADLY,
WAITED
FOR
A
VOICE.
MANY
AN
HOUR
HE
CROUCHED,
LISTENING,
SAW
NO
IMAGES
ANY
MORE,
FELL
INTO
EMPTINESS,
LET
HIMSELF
FALL,
WITHOUT
SEEING
A
PATH.
AND
WHEN
HE
FELT
THE
WOUND
BURNING,
HE
SILENTLY
SPOKE
THE
OM,
FILLED
HIMSELF
WITH
OM.
THE
MONKS
IN
THE
GARDEN
SAW
HIM,
AND
SINCE
HE
CROUCHED
FOR
MANY
HOURS,
AND
DUST
WAS
GATHERING
ON
HIS
GRAY
HAIR,
ONE
OF
THEM
CAME
TO
HIM
AND
PLACED
TWO
BANANAS
IN
FRONT
OF
HIM.
THE
OLD
MAN
DID
NOT
SEE
HIM.
FROM
THIS
PETRIFIED
STATE,
HE
WAS
AWOKEN
BY
A
HAND
TOUCHING
HIS
SHOULDER.
INSTANTLY,
HE
RECOGNISED
THIS
TOUCH,
THIS
TENDER,
BASHFUL
TOUCH,
AND
REGAINED
HIS
SENSES.
HE
ROSE
AND
GREETED
VASUDEVA,
WHO
HAD
FOLLOWED
HIM.
AND
WHEN
HE
LOOKED
INTO
VASUDEVA'S
FRIENDLY
FACE,
INTO
THE
SMALL
WRINKLES,
WHICH
WERE
AS
IF
THEY
WERE
FILLED
WITH
NOTHING
BUT
HIS
SMILE,
INTO
THE
HAPPY
EYES,
THEN
HE
SMILED
TOO.
NOW
HE
SAW
THE
BANANAS
LYING
IN
FRONT
OF
HIM,
PICKED
THEM
UP,
GAVE
ONE
TO
THE
FERRYMAN,
ATE
THE
OTHER
ONE
HIMSELF.
AFTER
THIS,
HE
SILENTLY
WENT
BACK
INTO
THE
FOREST
WITH
VASUDEVA,
RETURNED
HOME
TO
THE
FERRY.
NEITHER
ONE
TALKED
ABOUT
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
TODAY,
NEITHER
ONE
MENTIONED
THE
BOY'S
NAME,
NEITHER
ONE
SPOKE
ABOUT
HIM
RUNNING
AWAY,
NEITHER
ONE
SPOKE
ABOUT
THE
WOUND.
IN
THE
HUT,
SIDDHARTHA
LAY
DOWN
ON
HIS
BED,
AND
WHEN
AFTER
A
WHILE
VASUDEVA
CAME
TO
HIM,
TO
OFFER
HIM
A
BOWL
OF
COCONUT-MILK,
HE
ALREADY
FOUND
HIM
ASLEEP.
OM
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
THE
WOUND
CONTINUED
TO
BURN.
MANY
A
TRAVELLER
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
TO
FERRY
ACROSS
THE
RIVER
WHO
WAS
ACCOMPANIED
BY
A
SON
OR
A
DAUGHTER,
AND
HE
SAW
NONE
OF
THEM
WITHOUT
ENVYING
HIM,
WITHOUT
THINKING:
"SO
MANY,
SO
MANY
THOUSANDS
POSSESS
THIS
SWEETEST
OF
GOOD
FORTUNES--WHY
DON'T
I?
EVEN
BAD
PEOPLE,
EVEN
THIEVES
AND
ROBBERS
HAVE
CHILDREN
AND
LOVE
THEM,
AND
ARE
BEING
LOVED
BY
THEM,
ALL
EXCEPT
FOR
ME."
THUS
SIMPLY,
THUS
WITHOUT
REASON
HE
NOW
THOUGHT,
THUS
SIMILAR
TO
THE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE
HE
HAD
BECOME.
DIFFERENTLY
THAN
BEFORE,
HE
NOW
LOOKED
UPON
PEOPLE,
LESS
SMART,
LESS
PROUD,
BUT
INSTEAD
WARMER,
MORE
CURIOUS,
MORE
INVOLVED.
WHEN
HE
FERRIED
TRAVELLERS
OF
THE
ORDINARY
KIND,
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE,
BUSINESSMEN,
WARRIORS,
WOMEN,
THESE
PEOPLE
DID
NOT
SEEM
ALIEN
TO
HIM
AS
THEY
USED
TO:
HE
UNDERSTOOD
THEM,
HE
UNDERSTOOD
AND
SHARED
THEIR
LIFE,
WHICH
WAS
NOT
GUIDED
BY
THOUGHTS
AND
INSIGHT,
BUT
SOLELY
BY
URGES
AND
WISHES,
HE
FELT
LIKE
THEM.
THOUGH
HE
WAS
NEAR
PERFECTION
AND
WAS
BEARING
HIS
FINAL
WOUND,
IT
STILL
SEEMED
TO
HIM
AS
IF
THOSE
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE
WERE
HIS
BROTHERS,
THEIR
VANITIES,
DESIRES
FOR
POSSESSION,
AND
RIDICULOUS
ASPECTS
WERE
NO
LONGER
RIDICULOUS
TO
HIM,
BECAME
UNDERSTANDABLE,
BECAME
LOVABLE,
EVEN
BECAME
WORTHY
OF
VENERATION
TO
HIM.
THE
BLIND
LOVE
OF
A
MOTHER
FOR
HER
CHILD,
THE
STUPID,
BLIND
PRIDE
OF
A
CONCEITED
FATHER
FOR
HIS
ONLY
SON,
THE
BLIND,
WILD
DESIRE
OF
A
YOUNG,
VAIN
WOMAN
FOR
JEWELRY
AND
ADMIRING
GLANCES
FROM
MEN,
ALL
OF
THESE
URGES,
ALL
OF
THIS
CHILDISH
STUFF,
ALL
OF
THESE
SIMPLE,
FOOLISH,
BUT
IMMENSELY
STRONG,
STRONGLY
LIVING,
STRONGLY
PREVAILING
URGES
AND
DESIRES
WERE
NOW
NO
CHILDISH
NOTIONS
FOR
SIDDHARTHA
ANY
MORE,
HE
SAW
PEOPLE
LIVING
FOR
THEIR
SAKE,
SAW
THEM
ACHIEVING
INFINITELY
MUCH
FOR
THEIR
SAKE,
TRAVELLING,
CONDUCTING
WARS,
SUFFERING
INFINITELY
MUCH,
BEARING
INFINITELY
MUCH,
AND
HE
COULD
LOVE
THEM
FOR
IT,
HE
SAW
LIFE,
THAT
WHAT
IS
ALIVE,
THE
INDESTRUCTIBLE,
THE
BRAHMAN
IN
EACH
OF
THEIR
PASSIONS,
EACH
OF
THEIR
ACTS.
WORTHY
OF
LOVE
AND
ADMIRATION
WERE
THESE
PEOPLE
IN
THEIR
BLIND
LOYALTY,
THEIR
BLIND
STRENGTH
AND
TENACITY.
THEY
LACKED
NOTHING,
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
THE
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ONE,
THE
THINKER,
HAD
TO
PUT
HIM
ABOVE
THEM
EXCEPT
FOR
ONE
LITTLE
THING,
A
SINGLE,
TINY,
SMALL
THING:
THE
CONSCIOUSNESS,
THE
CONSCIOUS
THOUGHT
OF
THE
ONENESS
OF
ALL
LIFE.
AND
SIDDHARTHA
EVEN
DOUBTED
IN
MANY
AN
HOUR,
WHETHER
THIS
KNOWLEDGE,
THIS
THOUGHT
WAS
TO
BE
VALUED
THUS
HIGHLY,
WHETHER
IT
MIGHT
NOT
ALSO
PERHAPS
BE
A
CHILDISH
IDEA
OF
THE
THINKING
PEOPLE,
OF
THE
THINKING
AND
CHILDLIKE
PEOPLE.
IN
ALL
OTHER
RESPECTS,
THE
WORLDLY
PEOPLE
WERE
OF
EQUAL
RANK
TO
THE
WISE
MEN,
WERE
OFTEN
FAR
SUPERIOR
TO
THEM,
JUST
AS
ANIMALS
TOO
CAN,
AFTER
ALL,
IN
SOME
MOMENTS,
SEEM
TO
BE
SUPERIOR
TO
HUMANS
IN
THEIR
TOUGH,
UNRELENTING
PERFORMANCE
OF
WHAT
IS
NECESSARY.
SLOWLY
BLOSSOMED,
SLOWLY
RIPENED
IN
SIDDHARTHA
THE
REALISATION,
THE
KNOWLEDGE,
WHAT
WISDOM
ACTUALLY
WAS,
WHAT
THE
GOAL
OF
HIS
LONG
SEARCH
WAS.
IT
WAS
NOTHING
BUT
A
READINESS
OF
THE
SOUL,
AN
ABILITY,
A
SECRET
ART,
TO
THINK
EVERY
MOMENT,
WHILE
LIVING
HIS
LIFE,
THE
THOUGHT
OF
ONENESS,
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
FEEL
AND
INHALE
THE
ONENESS.
SLOWLY
THIS
BLOSSOMED
IN
HIM,
WAS
SHINING
BACK
AT
HIM
FROM
VASUDEVA'S
OLD,
CHILDLIKE
FACE:
HARMONY,
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
ETERNAL
PERFECTION
OF
THE
WORLD,
SMILING,
ONENESS.
BUT
THE
WOUND
STILL
BURNED,
LONGINGLY
AND
BITTERLY
SIDDHARTHA
THOUGHT
OF
HIS
SON,
NURTURED
HIS
LOVE
AND
TENDERNESS
IN
HIS
HEART,
ALLOWED
THE
PAIN
TO
GNAW
AT
HIM,
COMMITTED
ALL
FOOLISH
ACTS
OF
LOVE.
NOT
BY
ITSELF,
THIS
FLAME
WOULD
GO
OUT.
AND
ONE
DAY,
WHEN
THE
WOUND
BURNED
VIOLENTLY,
SIDDHARTHA
FERRIED
ACROSS
THE
RIVER,
DRIVEN
BY
A
YEARNING,
GOT
OFF
THE
BOAT
AND
WAS
WILLING
TO
GO
TO
THE
CITY
AND
TO
LOOK
FOR
HIS
SON.
THE
RIVER
FLOWED
SOFTLY
AND
QUIETLY,
IT
WAS
THE
DRY
SEASON,
BUT
ITS
VOICE
SOUNDED
STRANGE:
IT
LAUGHED!
IT
LAUGHED
CLEARLY.
THE
RIVER
LAUGHED,
IT
LAUGHED
BRIGHTLY
AND
CLEARLY
AT
THE
OLD
FERRYMAN.
SIDDHARTHA
STOPPED,
HE
BENT
OVER
THE
WATER,
IN
ORDER
TO
HEAR
EVEN
BETTER,
AND
HE
SAW
HIS
FACE
REFLECTED
IN
THE
QUIETLY
MOVING
WATERS,
AND
IN
THIS
REFLECTED
FACE
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING,
WHICH
REMINDED
HIM,
SOMETHING
HE
HAD
FORGOTTEN,
AND
AS
HE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IT,
HE
FOUND
IT:
THIS
FACE
RESEMBLED
ANOTHER
FACE,
WHICH
HE
USED
TO
KNOW
AND
LOVE
AND
ALSO
FEAR.
IT
RESEMBLED
HIS
FATHER'S
FACE,
THE
BRAHMAN.
AND
HE
REMEMBERED
HOW
HE,
A
LONG
TIME
AGO,
AS
A
YOUNG
MAN,
HAD
FORCED
HIS
FATHER
TO
LET
HIM
GO
TO
THE
PENITENTS,
HOW
HE
HAD
BED
HIS
FAREWELL
TO
HIM,
HOW
HE
HAD
GONE
AND
HAD
NEVER
COME
BACK.
HAD
HIS
FATHER
NOT
ALSO
SUFFERED
THE
SAME
PAIN
FOR
HIM,
WHICH
HE
NOW
SUFFERED
FOR
HIS
SON?
HAD
HIS
FATHER
NOT
LONG
SINCE
DIED,
ALONE,
WITHOUT
HAVING
SEEN
HIS
SON
AGAIN?
DID
HE
NOT
HAVE
TO
EXPECT
THE
SAME
FATE
FOR
HIMSELF?
WAS
IT
NOT
A
COMEDY,
A
STRANGE
AND
STUPID
MATTER,
THIS
REPETITION,
THIS
RUNNING
AROUND
IN
A
FATEFUL
CIRCLE?
THE
RIVER
LAUGHED.
YES,
SO
IT
WAS,
EVERYTHING
CAME
BACK,
WHICH
HAD
NOT
BEEN
SUFFERED
AND
SOLVED
UP
TO
ITS
END,
THE
SAME
PAIN
WAS
SUFFERED
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN.
BUT
SIDDHARTHA
WANT
BACK
INTO
THE
BOAT
AND
FERRIED
BACK
TO
THE
HUT,
THINKING
OF
HIS
FATHER,
THINKING
OF
HIS
SON,
LAUGHED
AT
BY
THE
RIVER,
AT
ODDS
WITH
HIMSELF,
TENDING
TOWARDS
DESPAIR,
AND
NOT
LESS
TENDING
TOWARDS
LAUGHING
ALONG
AT
(??
ÜBER)
HIMSELF
AND
THE
ENTIRE
WORLD.
ALAS,
THE
WOUND
WAS
NOT
BLOSSOMING
YET,
HIS
HEART
WAS
STILL
FIGHTING
HIS
FATE,
CHEERFULNESS
AND
VICTORY
WERE
NOT
YET
SHINING
FROM
HIS
SUFFERING.
NEVERTHELESS,
HE
FELT
HOPE,
AND
ONCE
HE
HAD
RETURNED
TO
THE
HUT,
HE
FELT
AN
UNDEFEATABLE
DESIRE
TO
OPEN
UP
TO
VASUDEVA,
TO
SHOW
HIM
EVERYTHING,
THE
MASTER
OF
LISTENING,
TO
SAY
EVERYTHING.
VASUDEVA
WAS
SITTING
IN
THE
HUT
AND
WEAVING
A
BASKET.
HE
NO
LONGER
USED
THE
FERRY-BOAT,
HIS
EYES
WERE
STARTING
TO
GET
WEAK,
AND
NOT
JUST
HIS
EYES;
HIS
ARMS
AND
HANDS
AS
WELL.
UNCHANGED
AND
FLOURISHING
WAS
ONLY
THE
JOY
AND
THE
CHEERFUL
BENEVOLENCE
OF
HIS
FACE.
SIDDHARTHA
SAT
DOWN
NEXT
TO
THE
OLD
MAN,
SLOWLY
HE
STARTED
TALKING.
WHAT
THEY
HAD
NEVER
TALKED
ABOUT,
HE
NOW
TOLD
HIM
OF,
OF
HIS
WALK
TO
THE
CITY,
AT
THAT
TIME,
OF
THE
BURNING
WOUND,
OF
HIS
ENVY
AT
THE
SIGHT
OF
HAPPY
FATHERS,
OF
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
FOOLISHNESS
OF
SUCH
WISHES,
OF
HIS
FUTILE
FIGHT
AGAINST
THEM.
HE
REPORTED
EVERYTHING,
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
SAY
EVERYTHING,
EVEN
THE
MOST
EMBARRASSING
PARTS,
EVERYTHING
COULD
BE
SAID,
EVERYTHING
SHOWN,
EVERYTHING
HE
COULD
TELL.
HE
PRESENTED
HIS
WOUND,
ALSO
TOLD
HOW
HE
FLED
TODAY,
HOW
HE
FERRIED
ACROSS
THE
WATER,
A
CHILDISH
RUN-AWAY,
WILLING
TO
WALK
TO
THE
CITY,
HOW
THE
RIVER
HAD
LAUGHED.
WHILE
HE
SPOKE,
SPOKE
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
WHILE
VASUDEVA
WAS
LISTENING
WITH
A
QUIET
FACE,
VASUDEVA'S
LISTENING
GAVE
SIDDHARTHA
A
STRONGER
SENSATION
THAN
EVER
BEFORE,
HE
SENSED
HOW
HIS
PAIN,
HIS
FEARS
FLOWED
OVER
TO
HIM,
HOW
HIS
SECRET
HOPE
FLOWED
OVER,
CAME
BACK
AT
HIM
FROM
HIS
COUNTERPART.
TO
SHOW
HIS
WOUND
TO
THIS
LISTENER
WAS
THE
SAME
AS
BATHING
IT
IN
THE
RIVER,
UNTIL
IT
HAD
COOLED
AND
BECOME
ONE
WITH
THE
RIVER.
WHILE
HE
WAS
STILL
SPEAKING,
STILL
ADMITTING
AND
CONFESSING,
SIDDHARTHA
FELT
MORE
AND
MORE
THAT
THIS
WAS
NO
LONGER
VASUDEVA,
NO
LONGER
A
HUMAN
BEING,
WHO
WAS
LISTENING
TO
HIM,
THAT
THIS
MOTIONLESS
LISTENER
WAS
ABSORBING
HIS
CONFESSION
INTO
HIMSELF
LIKE
A
TREE
THE
RAIN,
THAT
THIS
MOTIONLESS
MAN
WAS
THE
RIVER
ITSELF,
THAT
HE
WAS
GOD
HIMSELF,
THAT
HE
WAS
THE
ETERNAL
ITSELF.
AND
WHILE
SIDDHARTHA
STOPPED
THINKING
OF
HIMSELF
AND
HIS
WOUND,
THIS
REALISATION
OF
VASUDEVA'S
CHANGED
CHARACTER
TOOK
POSSESSION
OF
HIM,
AND
THE
MORE
HE
FELT
IT
AND
ENTERED
INTO
IT,
THE
LESS
WONDROUS
IT
BECAME,
THE
MORE
HE
REALISED
THAT
EVERYTHING
WAS
IN
ORDER
AND
NATURAL,
THAT
VASUDEVA
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
LIKE
THIS
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
ALMOST
FOREVER,
THAT
ONLY
HE
HAD
NOT
QUITE
RECOGNISED
IT,
YES,
THAT
HE
HIMSELF
HAD
ALMOST
REACHED
THE
SAME
STATE.
HE
FELT,
THAT
HE
WAS
NOW
SEEING
OLD
VASUDEVA
AS
THE
PEOPLE
SEE
THE
GODS,
AND
THAT
THIS
COULD
NOT
LAST;
IN
HIS
HEART,
HE
STARTED
BIDDING
HIS
FAREWELL
TO
VASUDEVA.
THOROUGH
ALL
THIS,
HE
TALKED
INCESSANTLY.
WHEN
HE
HAD
FINISHED
TALKING,
VASUDEVA
TURNED
HIS
FRIENDLY
EYES,
WHICH
HAD
GROWN
SLIGHTLY
WEAK,
AT
HIM,
SAID
NOTHING,
LET
HIS
SILENT
LOVE
AND
CHEERFULNESS,
UNDERSTANDING
AND
KNOWLEDGE,
SHINE
AT
HIM.
HE
TOOK
SIDDHARTHA'S
HAND,
LED
HIM
TO
THE
SEAT
BY
THE
BANK,
SAT
DOWN
WITH
HIM,
SMILED
AT
THE
RIVER.
"YOU'VE
HEARD
IT
LAUGH,"
HE
SAID.
"BUT
YOU
HAVEN'T
HEARD
EVERYTHING.
LET'S
LISTEN,
YOU'LL
HEAR
MORE."
THEY
LISTENED.
SOFTLY
SOUNDED
THE
RIVER,
SINGING
IN
MANY
VOICES.
SIDDHARTHA
LOOKED
INTO
THE
WATER,
AND
IMAGES
APPEARED
TO
HIM
IN
THE
MOVING
WATER:
HIS
FATHER
APPEARED,
LONELY,
MOURNING
FOR
HIS
SON;
HE
HIMSELF
APPEARED,
LONELY,
HE
ALSO
BEING
TIED
WITH
THE
BONDAGE
OF
YEARNING
TO
HIS
DISTANT
SON;
HIS
SON
APPEARED,
LONELY
AS
WELL,
THE
BOY,
GREEDILY
RUSHING
ALONG
THE
BURNING
COURSE
OF
HIS
YOUNG
WISHES,
EACH
ONE
HEADING
FOR
HIS
GOAL,
EACH
ONE
OBSESSED
BY
THE
GOAL,
EACH
ONE
SUFFERING.
THE
RIVER
SANG
WITH
A
VOICE
OF
SUFFERING,
LONGINGLY
IT
SANG,
LONGINGLY,
IT
FLOWED
TOWARDS
ITS
GOAL,
LAMENTINGLY
ITS
VOICE
SANG.
"DO
YOU
HEAR?"
VASUDEVA'S
MUTE
GAZE
ASKED.
SIDDHARTHA
NODDED.
"LISTEN
BETTER!"
VASUDEVA
WHISPERED.
SIDDHARTHA
MADE
AN
EFFORT
TO
LISTEN
BETTER.
THE
IMAGE
OF
HIS
FATHER,
HIS
OWN
IMAGE,
THE
IMAGE
OF
HIS
SON
MERGED,
KAMALA'S
IMAGE
ALSO
APPEARED
AND
WAS
DISPERSED,
AND
THE
IMAGE
OF
GOVINDA,
AND
OTHER
IMAGES,
AND
THEY
MERGED
WITH
EACH
OTHER,
TURNED
ALL
INTO
THE
RIVER,
HEADED
ALL,
BEING
THE
RIVER,
FOR
THE
GOAL,
LONGING,
DESIRING,
SUFFERING,
AND
THE
RIVER'S
VOICE
SOUNDED
FULL
OF
YEARNING,
FULL
OF
BURNING
WOE,
FULL
OF
UNSATISFIABLE
DESIRE.
FOR
THE
GOAL,
THE
RIVER
WAS
HEADING,
SIDDHARTHA
SAW
IT
HURRYING,
THE
RIVER,
WHICH
CONSISTED
OF
HIM
AND
HIS
LOVED
ONES
AND
OF
ALL
PEOPLE,
HE
HAD
EVER
SEEN,
ALL
OF
THESE
WAVES
AND
WATERS
WERE
HURRYING,
SUFFERING,
TOWARDS
GOALS,
MANY
GOALS,
THE
WATERFALL,
THE
LAKE,
THE
RAPIDS,
THE
SEA,
AND
ALL
GOALS
WERE
REACHED,
AND
EVERY
GOAL
WAS
FOLLOWED
BY
A
NEW
ONE,
AND
THE
WATER
TURNED
INTO
VAPOUR
AND
ROSE
TO
THE
SKY,
TURNED
INTO
RAIN
AND
POURED
DOWN
FROM
THE
SKY,
TURNED
INTO
A
SOURCE,
A
STREAM,
A
RIVER,
HEADED
FORWARD
ONCE
AGAIN,
FLOWED
ON
ONCE
AGAIN.
BUT
THE
LONGING
VOICE
HAD
CHANGED.
IT
STILL
RESOUNDED,
FULL
OF
SUFFERING,
SEARCHING,
BUT
OTHER
VOICES
JOINED
IT,
VOICES
OF
JOY
AND
OF
SUFFERING,
GOOD
AND
BAD
VOICES,
LAUGHING
AND
SAD
ONES,
A
HUNDRED
VOICES,
A
THOUSAND
VOICES.
SIDDHARTHA
LISTENED.
HE
WAS
NOW
NOTHING
BUT
A
LISTENER,
COMPLETELY
CONCENTRATED
ON
LISTENING,
COMPLETELY
EMPTY,
HE
FELT,
THAT
HE
HAD
NOW
FINISHED
LEARNING
TO
LISTEN.
OFTEN
BEFORE,
HE
HAD
HEARD
ALL
THIS,
THESE
MANY
VOICES
IN
THE
RIVER,
TODAY
IT
SOUNDED
NEW.
ALREADY,
HE
COULD
NO
LONGER
TELL
THE
MANY
VOICES
APART,
NOT
THE
HAPPY
ONES
FROM
THE
WEEPING
ONES,
NOT
THE
ONES
OF
CHILDREN
FROM
THOSE
OF
MEN,
THEY
ALL
BELONGED
TOGETHER,
THE
LAMENTATION
OF
YEARNING
AND
THE
LAUGHTER
OF
THE
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ONE,
THE
SCREAM
OF
RAGE
AND
THE
MOANING
OF
THE
DYING
ONES,
EVERYTHING
WAS
ONE,
EVERYTHING
WAS
INTERTWINED
AND
CONNECTED,
ENTANGLED
A
THOUSAND
TIMES.
AND
EVERYTHING
TOGETHER,
ALL
VOICES,
ALL
GOALS,
ALL
YEARNING,
ALL
SUFFERING,
ALL
PLEASURE,
ALL
THAT
WAS
GOOD
AND
EVIL,
ALL
OF
THIS
TOGETHER
WAS
THE
WORLD.
ALL
OF
IT
TOGETHER
WAS
THE
FLOW
OF
EVENTS,
WAS
THE
MUSIC
OF
LIFE.
AND
WHEN
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
LISTENING
ATTENTIVELY
TO
THIS
RIVER,
THIS
SONG
OF
A
THOUSAND
VOICES,
WHEN
HE
NEITHER
LISTENED
TO
THE
SUFFERING
NOR
THE
LAUGHTER,
WHEN
HE
DID
NOT
TIE
HIS
SOUL
TO
ANY
PARTICULAR
VOICE
AND
SUBMERGED
HIS
SELF
INTO
IT,
BUT
WHEN
HE
HEARD
THEM
ALL,
PERCEIVED
THE
WHOLE,
THE
ONENESS,
THEN
THE
GREAT
SONG
OF
THE
THOUSAND
VOICES
CONSISTED
OF
A
SINGLE
WORD,
WHICH
WAS
OM:
THE
PERFECTION.
"DO
YOU
HEAR,"
VASUDEVA'S
GAZE
ASKED
AGAIN.
BRIGHTLY,
VASUDEVA'S
SMILE
WAS
SHINING,
FLOATING
RADIANTLY
OVER
ALL
THE
WRINKLES
OF
HIS
OLD
FACE,
AS
THE
OM
WAS
FLOATING
IN
THE
AIR
OVER
ALL
THE
VOICES
OF
THE
RIVER.
BRIGHTLY
HIS
SMILE
WAS
SHINING,
WHEN
HE
LOOKED
AT
HIS
FRIEND,
AND
BRIGHTLY
THE
SAME
SMILE
WAS
NOW
STARTING
TO
SHINE
ON
SIDDHARTHA'S
FACE
AS
WELL.
HIS
WOUND
BLOSSOMED,
HIS
SUFFERING
WAS
SHINING,
HIS
SELF
HAD
FLOWN
INTO
THE
ONENESS.
IN
THIS
HOUR,
SIDDHARTHA
STOPPED
FIGHTING
HIS
FATE,
STOPPED
SUFFERING.
ON
HIS
FACE
FLOURISHED
THE
CHEERFULNESS
OF
A
KNOWLEDGE,
WHICH
IS
NO
LONGER
OPPOSED
BY
ANY
WILL,
WHICH
KNOWS
PERFECTION,
WHICH
IS
IN
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
FLOW
OF
EVENTS,
WITH
THE
CURRENT
OF
LIFE,
FULL
OF
SYMPATHY
FOR
THE
PAIN
OF
OTHERS,
FULL
OF
SYMPATHY
FOR
THE
PLEASURE
OF
OTHERS,
DEVOTED
TO
THE
FLOW,
BELONGING
TO
THE
ONENESS.
WHEN
VASUDEVA
ROSE
FROM
THE
SEAT
BY
THE
BANK,
WHEN
HE
LOOKED
INTO
SIDDHARTHA'S
EYES
AND
SAW
THE
CHEERFULNESS
OF
THE
KNOWLEDGE
SHINING
IN
THEM,
HE
SOFTLY
TOUCHED
HIS
SHOULDER
WITH
HIS
HAND,
IN
THIS
CAREFUL
AND
TENDER
MANNER,
AND
SAID:
"I'VE
BEEN
WAITING
FOR
THIS
HOUR,
MY
DEAR.
NOW
THAT
IT
HAS
COME,
LET
ME
LEAVE.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
I'VE
BEEN
WAITING
FOR
THIS
HOUR;
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
I'VE
BEEN
VASUDEVA
THE
FERRYMAN.
NOW
IT'S
ENOUGH.
FAREWELL,
HUT,
FAREWELL,
RIVER,
FAREWELL,
SIDDHARTHA!"
SIDDHARTHA
MADE
A
DEEP
BOW
BEFORE
HIM
WHO
BID
HIS
FAREWELL.
"I'VE
KNOWN
IT,"
HE
SAID
QUIETLY.
"YOU'LL
GO
INTO
THE
FORESTS?"
"I'M
GOING
INTO
THE
FORESTS,
I'M
GOING
INTO
THE
ONENESS,"
SPOKE
VASUDEVA
WITH
A
BRIGHT
SMILE.
WITH
A
BRIGHT
SMILE,
HE
LEFT;
SIDDHARTHA
WATCHED
HIM
LEAVING.
WITH
DEEP
JOY,
WITH
DEEP
SOLEMNITY
HE
WATCHED
HIM
LEAVE,
SAW
HIS
STEPS
FULL
OF
PEACE,
SAW
HIS
HEAD
FULL
OF
LUSTRE,
SAW
HIS
BODY
FULL
OF
LIGHT.
GOVINDA
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
MONKS,
GOVINDA
USED
TO
SPEND
THE
TIME
OF
REST
BETWEEN
PILGRIMAGES
IN
THE
PLEASURE-GROVE,
WHICH
THE
COURTESAN
KAMALA
HAD
GIVEN
TO
THE
FOLLOWERS
OF
GOTAMA
FOR
A
GIFT.
HE
HEARD
TALK
OF
AN
OLD
FERRYMAN,
WHO
LIVED
ONE
DAY'S
JOURNEY
AWAY
BY
THE
RIVER,
AND
WHO
WAS
REGARDED
AS
A
WISE
MAN
BY
MANY.
WHEN
GOVINDA
WENT
BACK
ON
HIS
WAY,
HE
CHOSE
THE
PATH
TO
THE
FERRY,
EAGER
TO
SEE
THE
FERRYMAN.
BECAUSE,
THOUGH
HE
HAD
LIVED
HIS
ENTIRE
LIFE
BY
THE
RULES,
THOUGH
HE
WAS
ALSO
LOOKED
UPON
WITH
VENERATION
BY
THE
YOUNGER
MONKS
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
HIS
AGE
AND
HIS
MODESTY,
THE
RESTLESSNESS
AND
THE
SEARCHING
STILL
HAD
NOT
PERISHED
FROM
HIS
HEART.
HE
CAME
TO
THE
RIVER
AND
ASKED
THE
OLD
MAN
TO
FERRY
HIM
OVER,
AND
WHEN
THEY
GOT
OFF
THE
BOAT
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE,
HE
SAID
TO
THE
OLD
MAN:
"YOU'RE
VERY
GOOD
TO
US
MONKS
AND
PILGRIMS,
YOU
HAVE
ALREADY
FERRIED
MANY
OF
US
ACROSS
THE
RIVER.
AREN'T
YOU
TOO,
FERRYMAN,
A
SEARCHER
FOR
THE
RIGHT
PATH?"
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA,
SMILING
FROM
HIS
OLD
EYES:
"DO
YOU
CALL
YOURSELF
A
SEARCHER,
OH
VENERABLE
ONE,
THOUGH
YOU
ARE
ALREADY
OF
AN
OLD
IN
YEARS
AND
ARE
WEARING
THE
ROBE
OF
GOTAMA'S
MONKS?"
"IT'S
TRUE,
I'M
OLD,"
SPOKE
GOVINDA,
"BUT
I
HAVEN'T
STOPPED
SEARCHING.
NEVER
I'LL
STOP
SEARCHING,
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
MY
DESTINY.
YOU
TOO,
SO
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME,
HAVE
BEEN
SEARCHING.
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
TO
TELL
ME
SOMETHING,
OH
HONOURABLE
ONE?"
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"WHAT
SHOULD
I
POSSIBLY
HAVE
TO
TELL
YOU,
OH
VENERABLE
ONE?
PERHAPS
THAT
YOU'RE
SEARCHING
FAR
TOO
MUCH?
THAT
IN
ALL
THAT
SEARCHING,
YOU
DON'T
FIND
THE
TIME
FOR
FINDING?"
"HOW
COME?"
ASKED
GOVINDA.
"WHEN
SOMEONE
IS
SEARCHING,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA,
"THEN
IT
MIGHT
EASILY
HAPPEN
THAT
THE
ONLY
THING
HIS
EYES
STILL
SEE
IS
THAT
WHAT
HE
SEARCHES
FOR,
THAT
HE
IS
UNABLE
TO
FIND
ANYTHING,
TO
LET
ANYTHING
ENTER
HIS
MIND,
BECAUSE
HE
ALWAYS
THINKS
OF
NOTHING
BUT
THE
OBJECT
OF
HIS
SEARCH,
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
A
GOAL,
BECAUSE
HE
IS
OBSESSED
BY
THE
GOAL.
SEARCHING
MEANS:
HAVING
A
GOAL.
BUT
FINDING
MEANS:
BEING
FREE,
BEING
OPEN,
HAVING
NO
GOAL.
YOU,
OH
VENERABLE
ONE,
ARE
PERHAPS
INDEED
A
SEARCHER,
BECAUSE,
STRIVING
FOR
YOUR
GOAL,
THERE
ARE
MANY
THINGS
YOU
DON'T
SEE,
WHICH
ARE
DIRECTLY
IN
FRONT
OF
YOUR
EYES."
"I
DON'T
QUITE
UNDERSTAND
YET,"
ASKED
GOVINDA,
"WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
BY
THIS?"
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"A
LONG
TIME
AGO,
OH
VENERABLE
ONE,
MANY
YEARS
AGO,
YOU'VE
ONCE
BEFORE
BEEN
AT
THIS
RIVER
AND
HAVE
FOUND
A
SLEEPING
MAN
BY
THE
RIVER,
AND
HAVE
SAT
DOWN
WITH
HIM
TO
GUARD
HIS
SLEEP.
BUT,
OH
GOVINDA,
YOU
DID
NOT
RECOGNISE
THE
SLEEPING
MAN."
ASTONISHED,
AS
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
THE
OBJECT
OF
A
MAGIC
SPELL,
THE
MONK
LOOKED
INTO
THE
FERRYMAN'S
EYES.
"ARE
YOU
SIDDHARTHA?"
HE
ASKED
WITH
A
TIMID
VOICE.
"I
WOULDN'T
HAVE
RECOGNISED
YOU
THIS
TIME
AS
WELL!
FROM
MY
HEART,
I'M
GREETING
YOU,
SIDDHARTHA;
FROM
MY
HEART,
I'M
HAPPY
TO
SEE
YOU
ONCE
AGAIN!
YOU'VE
CHANGED
A
LOT,
MY
FRIEND.--AND
SO
YOU'VE
NOW
BECOME
A
FERRYMAN?"
IN
A
FRIENDLY
MANNER,
SIDDHARTHA
LAUGHED.
"A
FERRYMAN,
YES.
MANY
PEOPLE,
GOVINDA,
HAVE
TO
CHANGE
A
LOT,
HAVE
TO
WEAR
MANY
A
ROBE,
I
AM
ONE
OF
THOSE,
MY
DEAR.
BE
WELCOME,
GOVINDA,
AND
SPEND
THE
NIGHT
IN
MY
HUT."
GOVINDA
STAYED
THE
NIGHT
IN
THE
HUT
AND
SLEPT
ON
THE
BED
WHICH
USED
TO
BE
VASUDEVA'S
BED.
MANY
QUESTIONS
HE
POSED
TO
THE
FRIEND
OF
HIS
YOUTH,
MANY
THINGS
SIDDHARTHA
HAD
TO
TELL
HIM
FROM
HIS
LIFE.
WHEN
IN
THE
NEXT
MORNING
THE
TIME
HAD
COME
TO
START
THE
DAY'S
JOURNEY,
GOVINDA
SAID,
NOT
WITHOUT
HESITATION,
THESE
WORDS:
"BEFORE
I'LL
CONTINUE
ON
MY
PATH,
SIDDHARTHA,
PERMIT
ME
TO
ASK
ONE
MORE
QUESTION.
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
TEACHING?
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
FAITH,
OR
A
KNOWLEDGE,
YOU
FOLLOW,
WHICH
HELPS
YOU
TO
LIVE
AND
TO
DO
RIGHT?"
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"YOU
KNOW,
MY
DEAR,
THAT
I
ALREADY
AS
A
YOUNG
MAN,
IN
THOSE
DAYS
WHEN
WE
LIVED
WITH
THE
PENITENTS
IN
THE
FOREST,
STARTED
TO
DISTRUST
TEACHERS
AND
TEACHINGS
AND
TO
TURN
MY
BACK
TO
THEM.
I
HAVE
STUCK
WITH
THIS.
NEVERTHELESS,
I
HAVE
HAD
MANY
TEACHERS
SINCE
THEN.
A
BEAUTIFUL
COURTESAN
HAS
BEEN
MY
TEACHER
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
AND
A
RICH
MERCHANT
WAS
MY
TEACHER,
AND
SOME
GAMBLERS
WITH
DICE.
ONCE,
EVEN
A
FOLLOWER
OF
BUDDHA,
TRAVELLING
ON
FOOT,
HAS
BEEN
MY
TEACHER;
HE
SAT
WITH
ME
WHEN
I
HAD
FALLEN
ASLEEP
IN
THE
FOREST,
ON
THE
PILGRIMAGE.
I'VE
ALSO
LEARNED
FROM
HIM,
I'M
ALSO
GRATEFUL
TO
HIM,
VERY
GRATEFUL.
BUT
MOST
OF
ALL,
I
HAVE
LEARNED
HERE
FROM
THIS
RIVER
AND
FROM
MY
PREDECESSOR,
THE
FERRYMAN
VASUDEVA.
HE
WAS
A
VERY
SIMPLE
PERSON,
VASUDEVA,
HE
WAS
NO
THINKER,
BUT
HE
KNEW
WHAT
IS
NECESSARY
JUST
AS
WELL
AS
GOTAMA,
HE
WAS
A
PERFECT
MAN,
A
SAINT."
GOVINDA
SAID:
"STILL,
OH
SIDDHARTHA,
YOU
LOVE
A
BIT
TO
MOCK
PEOPLE,
AS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME.
I
BELIEVE
IN
YOU
AND
KNOW
THAT
YOU
HAVEN'T
FOLLOWED
A
TEACHER.
BUT
HAVEN'T
YOU
FOUND
SOMETHING
BY
YOURSELF,
THOUGH
YOU'VE
FOUND
NO
TEACHINGS,
YOU
STILL
FOUND
CERTAIN
THOUGHTS,
CERTAIN
INSIGHTS,
WHICH
ARE
YOUR
OWN
AND
WHICH
HELP
YOU
TO
LIVE?
IF
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TELL
ME
SOME
OF
THESE,
YOU
WOULD
DELIGHT
MY
HEART."
QUOTH
SIDDHARTHA:
"I'VE
HAD
THOUGHTS,
YES,
AND
INSIGHT,
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN.
SOMETIMES,
FOR
AN
HOUR
OR
FOR
AN
ENTIRE
DAY,
I
HAVE
FELT
KNOWLEDGE
IN
ME,
AS
ONE
WOULD
FEEL
LIFE
IN
ONE'S
HEART.
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
MANY
THOUGHTS,
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
HARD
FOR
ME
TO
CONVEY
THEM
TO
YOU.
LOOK,
MY
DEAR
GOVINDA,
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
MY
THOUGHTS,
WHICH
I
HAVE
FOUND:
WISDOM
CANNOT
BE
PASSED
ON.
WISDOM
WHICH
A
WISE
MAN
TRIES
TO
PASS
ON
TO
SOMEONE
ALWAYS
SOUNDS
LIKE
FOOLISHNESS."
"ARE
YOU
KIDDING?"
ASKED
GOVINDA.
"I'M
NOT
KIDDING.
I'M
TELLING
YOU
WHAT
I'VE
FOUND.
KNOWLEDGE
CAN
BE
CONVEYED,
BUT
NOT
WISDOM.
IT
CAN
BE
FOUND,
IT
CAN
BE
LIVED,
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
BE
CARRIED
BY
IT,
MIRACLES
CAN
BE
PERFORMED
WITH
IT,
BUT
IT
CANNOT
BE
EXPRESSED
IN
WORDS
AND
TAUGHT.
THIS
WAS
WHAT
I,
EVEN
AS
A
YOUNG
MAN,
SOMETIMES
SUSPECTED,
WHAT
HAS
DRIVEN
ME
AWAY
FROM
THE
TEACHERS.
I
HAVE
FOUND
A
THOUGHT,
GOVINDA,
WHICH
YOU'LL
AGAIN
REGARD
AS
A
JOKE
OR
FOOLISHNESS,
BUT
WHICH
IS
MY
BEST
THOUGHT.
IT
SAYS:
THE
OPPOSITE
OF
EVERY
TRUTH
IS
JUST
AS
TRUE!
THAT'S
LIKE
THIS:
ANY
TRUTH
CAN
ONLY
BE
EXPRESSED
AND
PUT
INTO
WORDS
WHEN
IT
IS
ONE-SIDED.
EVERYTHING
IS
ONE-SIDED
WHICH
CAN
BE
THOUGHT
WITH
THOUGHTS
AND
SAID
WITH
WORDS,
IT'S
ALL
ONE-SIDED,
ALL
JUST
ONE
HALF,
ALL
LACKS
COMPLETENESS,
ROUNDNESS,
ONENESS.
WHEN
THE
EXALTED
GOTAMA
SPOKE
IN
HIS
TEACHINGS
OF
THE
WORLD,
HE
HAD
TO
DIVIDE
IT
INTO
SANSARA
AND
NIRVANA,
INTO
DECEPTION
AND
TRUTH,
INTO
SUFFERING
AND
SALVATION.
IT
CANNOT
BE
DONE
DIFFERENTLY,
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
FOR
HIM
WHO
WANTS
TO
TEACH.
BUT
THE
WORLD
ITSELF,
WHAT
EXISTS
AROUND
US
AND
INSIDE
OF
US,
IS
NEVER
ONE-SIDED.
A
PERSON
OR
AN
ACT
IS
NEVER
ENTIRELY
SANSARA
OR
ENTIRELY
NIRVANA,
A
PERSON
IS
NEVER
ENTIRELY
HOLY
OR
ENTIRELY
SINFUL.
IT
DOES
REALLY
SEEM
LIKE
THIS,
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
SUBJECT
TO
DECEPTION,
AS
IF
TIME
WAS
SOMETHING
REAL.
TIME
IS
NOT
REAL,
GOVINDA,
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
THIS
OFTEN
AND
OFTEN
AGAIN.
AND
IF
TIME
IS
NOT
REAL,
THEN
THE
GAP
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
BETWEEN
THE
WORLD
AND
THE
ETERNITY,
BETWEEN
SUFFERING
AND
BLISSFULNESS,
BETWEEN
EVIL
AND
GOOD,
IS
ALSO
A
DECEPTION."
"HOW
COME?"
ASKED
GOVINDA
TIMIDLY.
"LISTEN
WELL,
MY
DEAR,
LISTEN
WELL!
THE
SINNER,
WHICH
I
AM
AND
WHICH
YOU
ARE,
IS
A
SINNER,
BUT
IN
TIMES
TO
COME
HE
WILL
BE
BRAHMA
AGAIN,
HE
WILL
REACH
THE
NIRVANA,
WILL
BE
BUDDHA--AND
NOW
SEE:
THESE
'TIMES
TO
COME'
ARE
A
DECEPTION,
ARE
ONLY
A
PARABLE!
THE
SINNER
IS
NOT
ON
HIS
WAY
TO
BECOME
A
BUDDHA,
HE
IS
NOT
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
DEVELOPING,
THOUGH
OUR
CAPACITY
FOR
THINKING
DOES
NOT
KNOW
HOW
ELSE
TO
PICTURE
THESE
THINGS.
NO,
WITHIN
THE
SINNER
IS
NOW
AND
TODAY
ALREADY
THE
FUTURE
BUDDHA,
HIS
FUTURE
IS
ALREADY
ALL
THERE,
YOU
HAVE
TO
WORSHIP
IN
HIM,
IN
YOU,
IN
EVERYONE
THE
BUDDHA
WHICH
IS
COMING
INTO
BEING,
THE
POSSIBLE,
THE
HIDDEN
BUDDHA.
THE
WORLD,
MY
FRIEND
GOVINDA,
IS
NOT
IMPERFECT,
OR
ON
A
SLOW
PATH
TOWARDS
PERFECTION:
NO,
IT
IS
PERFECT
IN
EVERY
MOMENT,
ALL
SIN
ALREADY
CARRIES
THE
DIVINE
FORGIVENESS
IN
ITSELF,
ALL
SMALL
CHILDREN
ALREADY
HAVE
THE
OLD
PERSON
IN
THEMSELVES,
ALL
INFANTS
ALREADY
HAVE
DEATH,
ALL
DYING
PEOPLE
THE
ETERNAL
LIFE.
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
FOR
ANY
PERSON
TO
SEE
HOW
FAR
ANOTHER
ONE
HAS
ALREADY
PROGRESSED
ON
HIS
PATH;
IN
THE
ROBBER
AND
DICE-GAMBLER,
THE
BUDDHA
IS
WAITING;
IN
THE
BRAHMAN,
THE
ROBBER
IS
WAITING.
IN
DEEP
MEDITATION,
THERE
IS
THE
POSSIBILITY
TO
PUT
TIME
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE,
TO
SEE
ALL
LIFE
WHICH
WAS,
IS,
AND
WILL
BE
AS
IF
IT
WAS
SIMULTANEOUS,
AND
THERE
EVERYTHING
IS
GOOD,
EVERYTHING
IS
PERFECT,
EVERYTHING
IS
BRAHMAN.
THEREFORE,
I
SEE
WHATEVER
EXISTS
AS
GOOD,
DEATH
IS
TO
ME
LIKE
LIFE,
SIN
LIKE
HOLINESS,
WISDOM
LIKE
FOOLISHNESS,
EVERYTHING
HAS
TO
BE
AS
IT
IS,
EVERYTHING
ONLY
REQUIRES
MY
CONSENT,
ONLY
MY
WILLINGNESS,
MY
LOVING
AGREEMENT,
TO
BE
GOOD
FOR
ME,
TO
DO
NOTHING
BUT
WORK
FOR
MY
BENEFIT,
TO
BE
UNABLE
TO
EVER
HARM
ME.
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
ON
MY
BODY
AND
ON
MY
SOUL
THAT
I
NEEDED
SIN
VERY
MUCH,
I
NEEDED
LUST,
THE
DESIRE
FOR
POSSESSIONS,
VANITY,
AND
NEEDED
THE
MOST
SHAMEFUL
DESPAIR,
IN
ORDER
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
GIVE
UP
ALL
RESISTANCE,
IN
ORDER
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
LOVE
THE
WORLD,
IN
ORDER
TO
STOP
COMPARING
IT
TO
SOME
WORLD
I
WISHED,
I
IMAGINED,
SOME
KIND
OF
PERFECTION
I
HAD
MADE
UP,
BUT
TO
LEAVE
IT
AS
IT
IS
AND
TO
LOVE
IT
AND
TO
ENJOY
BEING
A
PART
OF
IT.--THESE,
OH
GOVINDA,
ARE
SOME
OF
THE
THOUGHTS
WHICH
HAVE
COME
INTO
MY
MIND."
SIDDHARTHA
BENT
DOWN,
PICKED
UP
A
STONE
FROM
THE
GROUND,
AND
WEIGHED
IT
IN
HIS
HAND.
"THIS
HERE,"
HE
SAID
PLAYING
WITH
IT,
"IS
A
STONE,
AND
WILL,
AFTER
A
CERTAIN
TIME,
PERHAPS
TURN
INTO
SOIL,
AND
WILL
TURN
FROM
SOIL
INTO
A
PLANT
OR
ANIMAL
OR
HUMAN
BEING.
IN
THE
PAST,
I
WOULD
HAVE
SAID:
THIS
STONE
IS
JUST
A
STONE,
IT
IS
WORTHLESS,
IT
BELONGS
TO
THE
WORLD
OF
THE
MAJA;
BUT
BECAUSE
IT
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
BECOME
ALSO
A
HUMAN
BEING
AND
A
SPIRIT
IN
THE
CYCLE
OF
TRANSFORMATIONS,
THEREFORE
I
ALSO
GRANT
IT
IMPORTANCE.
THUS,
I
WOULD
PERHAPS
HAVE
THOUGHT
IN
THE
PAST.
BUT
TODAY
I
THINK:
THIS
STONE
IS
A
STONE,
IT
IS
ALSO
ANIMAL,
IT
IS
ALSO
GOD,
IT
IS
ALSO
BUDDHA,
I
DO
NOT
VENERATE
AND
LOVE
IT
BECAUSE
IT
COULD
TURN
INTO
THIS
OR
THAT,
BUT
RATHER
BECAUSE
IT
IS
ALREADY
AND
ALWAYS
EVERYTHING--
AND
IT
IS
THIS
VERY
FACT,
THAT
IT
IS
A
STONE,
THAT
IT
APPEARS
TO
ME
NOW
AND
TODAY
AS
A
STONE,
THIS
IS
WHY
I
LOVE
IT
AND
SEE
WORTH
AND
PURPOSE
IN
EACH
OF
ITS
VEINS
AND
CAVITIES,
IN
THE
YELLOW,
IN
THE
GRAY,
IN
THE
HARDNESS,
IN
THE
SOUND
IT
MAKES
WHEN
I
KNOCK
AT
IT,
IN
THE
DRYNESS
OR
WETNESS
OF
ITS
SURFACE.
THERE
ARE
STONES
WHICH
FEEL
LIKE
OIL
OR
SOAP,
AND
OTHERS
LIKE
LEAVES,
OTHERS
LIKE
SAND,
AND
EVERY
ONE
IS
SPECIAL
AND
PRAYS
THE
OM
IN
ITS
OWN
WAY,
EACH
ONE
IS
BRAHMAN,
BUT
SIMULTANEOUSLY
AND
JUST
AS
MUCH
IT
IS
A
STONE,
IS
OILY
OR
JUICY,
AND
THIS
IS
THIS
VERY
FACT
WHICH
I
LIKE
AND
REGARD
AS
WONDERFUL
AND
WORTHY
OF
WORSHIP.--BUT
LET
ME
SPEAK
NO
MORE
OF
THIS.
THE
WORDS
ARE
NOT
GOOD
FOR
THE
SECRET
MEANING,
EVERYTHING
ALWAYS
BECOMES
A
BIT
DIFFERENT,
AS
SOON
AS
IT
IS
PUT
INTO
WORDS,
GETS
DISTORTED
A
BIT,
A
BIT
SILLY--YES,
AND
THIS
IS
ALSO
VERY
GOOD,
AND
I
LIKE
IT
A
LOT,
I
ALSO
VERY
MUCH
AGREE
WITH
THIS,
THAT
THIS
WHAT
IS
ONE
MAN'S
TREASURE
AND
WISDOM
ALWAYS
SOUNDS
LIKE
FOOLISHNESS
TO
ANOTHER
PERSON."
GOVINDA
LISTENED
SILENTLY.
"WHY
HAVE
YOU
TOLD
ME
THIS
ABOUT
THE
STONE?"
HE
ASKED
HESITANTLY
AFTER
A
PAUSE.
"I
DID
IT
WITHOUT
ANY
SPECIFIC
INTENTION.
OR
PERHAPS
WHAT
I
MEANT
WAS,
THAT
LOVE
THIS
VERY
STONE,
AND
THE
RIVER,
AND
ALL
THESE
THINGS
WE
ARE
LOOKING
AT
AND
FROM
WHICH
WE
CAN
LEARN.
I
CAN
LOVE
A
STONE,
GOVINDA,
AND
ALSO
A
TREE
OR
A
PIECE
OF
BARK.
THIS
ARE
THINGS,
AND
THINGS
CAN
BE
LOVED.
BUT
I
CANNOT
LOVE
WORDS.
THEREFORE,
TEACHINGS
ARE
NO
GOOD
FOR
ME,
THEY
HAVE
NO
HARDNESS,
NO
SOFTNESS,
NO
COLOURS,
NO
EDGES,
NO
SMELL,
NO
TASTE,
THEY
HAVE
NOTHING
BUT
WORDS.
PERHAPS
IT
ARE
THESE
WHICH
KEEP
YOU
FROM
FINDING
PEACE,
PERHAPS
IT
ARE
THE
MANY
WORDS.
BECAUSE
SALVATION
AND
VIRTUE
AS
WELL,
SANSARA
AND
NIRVANA
AS
WELL,
ARE
MERE
WORDS,
GOVINDA.
THERE
IS
NO
THING
WHICH
WOULD
BE
NIRVANA;
THERE
IS
JUST
THE
WORD
NIRVANA."
QUOTH
GOVINDA:
"NOT
JUST
A
WORD,
MY
FRIEND,
IS
NIRVANA.
IT
IS
A
THOUGHT."
SIDDHARTHA
CONTINUED:
"A
THOUGHT,
IT
MIGHT
BE
SO.
I
MUST
CONFESS
TO
YOU,
MY
DEAR:
I
DON'T
DIFFERENTIATE
MUCH
BETWEEN
THOUGHTS
AND
WORDS.
TO
BE
HONEST,
I
ALSO
HAVE
NO
HIGH
OPINION
OF
THOUGHTS.
I
HAVE
A
BETTER
OPINION
OF
THINGS.
HERE
ON
THIS
FERRY-BOAT,
FOR
INSTANCE,
A
MAN
HAS
BEEN
MY
PREDECESSOR
AND
TEACHER,
A
HOLY
MAN,
WHO
HAS
FOR
MANY
YEARS
SIMPLY
BELIEVED
IN
THE
RIVER,
NOTHING
ELSE.
HE
HAD
NOTICED
THAT
THE
RIVER'S
SPOKE
TO
HIM,
HE
LEARNED
FROM
IT,
IT
EDUCATED
AND
TAUGHT
HIM,
THE
RIVER
SEEMED
TO
BE
A
GOD
TO
HIM,
FOR
MANY
YEARS
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
THAT
EVERY
WIND,
EVERY
CLOUD,
EVERY
BIRD,
EVERY
BEETLE
WAS
JUST
AS
DIVINE
AND
KNOWS
JUST
AS
MUCH
AND
CAN
TEACH
JUST
AS
MUCH
AS
THE
WORSHIPPED
RIVER.
BUT
WHEN
THIS
HOLY
MAN
WENT
INTO
THE
FORESTS,
HE
KNEW
EVERYTHING,
KNEW
MORE
THAN
YOU
AND
ME,
WITHOUT
TEACHERS,
WITHOUT
BOOKS,
ONLY
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
BELIEVED
IN
THE
RIVER."
GOVINDA
SAID:
"BUT
IS
THAT
WHAT
YOU
CALL
`THINGS',
ACTUALLY
SOMETHING
REAL,
SOMETHING
WHICH
HAS
EXISTENCE?
ISN'T
IT
JUST
A
DECEPTION
OF
THE
MAJA,
JUST
AN
IMAGE
AND
ILLUSION?
YOUR
STONE,
YOUR
TREE,
YOUR
RIVER--
ARE
THEY
ACTUALLY
A
REALITY?"
"THIS
TOO,"
SPOKE
SIDDHARTHA,
"I
DO
NOT
CARE
VERY
MUCH
ABOUT.
LET
THE
THINGS
BE
ILLUSIONS
OR
NOT,
AFTER
ALL
I
WOULD
THEN
ALSO
BE
AN
ILLUSION,
AND
THUS
THEY
ARE
ALWAYS
LIKE
ME.
THIS
IS
WHAT
MAKES
THEM
SO
DEAR
AND
WORTHY
OF
VENERATION
FOR
ME:
THEY
ARE
LIKE
ME.
THEREFORE,
I
CAN
LOVE
THEM.
AND
THIS
IS
NOW
A
TEACHING
YOU
WILL
LAUGH
ABOUT:
LOVE,
OH
GOVINDA,
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
THING
OF
ALL.
TO
THOROUGHLY
UNDERSTAND
THE
WORLD,
TO
EXPLAIN
IT,
TO
DESPISE
IT,
MAY
BE
THE
THING
GREAT
THINKERS
DO.
BUT
I'M
ONLY
INTERESTED
IN
BEING
ABLE
TO
LOVE
THE
WORLD,
NOT
TO
DESPISE
IT,
NOT
TO
HATE
IT
AND
ME,
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
LOOK
UPON
IT
AND
ME
AND
ALL
BEINGS
WITH
LOVE
AND
ADMIRATION
AND
GREAT
RESPECT."
"THIS
I
UNDERSTAND,"
SPOKE
GOVINDA.
"BUT
THIS
VERY
THING
WAS
DISCOVERED
BY
THE
EXALTED
ONE
TO
BE
A
DECEPTION.
HE
COMMANDS
BENEVOLENCE,
CLEMENCY,
SYMPATHY,
TOLERANCE,
BUT
NOT
LOVE;
HE
FORBADE
US
TO
TIE
OUR
HEART
IN
LOVE
TO
EARTHLY
THINGS."
"I
KNOW
IT,"
SAID
SIDDHARTHA;
HIS
SMILE
SHONE
GOLDEN.
"I
KNOW
IT,
GOVINDA.
AND
BEHOLD,
WITH
THIS
WE
ARE
RIGHT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
THICKET
OF
OPINIONS,
IN
THE
DISPUTE
ABOUT
WORDS.
FOR
I
CANNOT
DENY,
MY
WORDS
OF
LOVE
ARE
IN
A
CONTRADICTION,
A
SEEMING
CONTRADICTION
WITH
GOTAMA'S
WORDS.
FOR
THIS
VERY
REASON,
I
DISTRUST
IN
WORDS
SO
MUCH,
FOR
I
KNOW,
THIS
CONTRADICTION
IS
A
DECEPTION.
I
KNOW
THAT
I
AM
IN
AGREEMENT
WITH
GOTAMA.
HOW
SHOULD
HE
NOT
KNOW
LOVE,
HE,
WHO
HAS
DISCOVERED
ALL
ELEMENTS
OF
HUMAN
EXISTENCE
IN
THEIR
TRANSITORINESS,
IN
THEIR
MEANINGLESSNESS,
AND
YET
LOVED
PEOPLE
THUS
MUCH,
TO
USE
A
LONG,
LABORIOUS
LIFE
ONLY
TO
HELP
THEM,
TO
TEACH
THEM!
EVEN
WITH
HIM,
EVEN
WITH
YOUR
GREAT
TEACHER,
I
PREFER
THE
THING
OVER
THE
WORDS,
PLACE
MORE
IMPORTANCE
ON
HIS
ACTS
AND
LIFE
THAN
ON
HIS
SPEECHES,
MORE
ON
THE
GESTURES
OF
HIS
HAND
THAN
HIS
OPINIONS.
NOT
IN
HIS
SPEECH,
NOT
IN
HIS
THOUGHTS,
I
SEE
HIS
GREATNESS,
ONLY
IN
HIS
ACTIONS,
IN
HIS
LIFE."
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
THE
TWO
OLD
MEN
SAID
NOTHING.
THEN
SPOKE
GOVINDA,
WHILE
BOWING
FOR
A
FAREWELL:
"I
THANK
YOU,
SIDDHARTHA,
FOR
TELLING
ME
SOME
OF
YOUR
THOUGHTS.
THEY
ARE
PARTIALLY
STRANGE
THOUGHTS,
NOT
ALL
HAVE
BEEN
INSTANTLY
UNDERSTANDABLE
TO
ME.
THIS
BEING
AS
IT
MAY,
I
THANK
YOU,
AND
I
WISH
YOU
TO
HAVE
CALM
DAYS."
(BUT
SECRETLY
HE
THOUGHT
TO
HIMSELF:
THIS
SIDDHARTHA
IS
A
BIZARRE
PERSON,
HE
EXPRESSES
BIZARRE
THOUGHTS,
HIS
TEACHINGS
SOUND
FOOLISH.
SO
DIFFERENTLY
SOUND
THE
EXALTED
ONE'S
PURE
TEACHINGS,
CLEARER,
PURER,
MORE
COMPREHENSIBLE,
NOTHING
STRANGE,
FOOLISH,
OR
SILLY
IS
CONTAINED
IN
THEM.
BUT
DIFFERENT
FROM
HIS
THOUGHTS
SEEMED
TO
ME
SIDDHARTHA'S
HANDS
AND
FEET,
HIS
EYES,
HIS
FOREHEAD,
HIS
BREATH,
HIS
SMILE,
HIS
GREETING,
HIS
WALK.
NEVER
AGAIN,
AFTER
OUR
EXALTED
GOTAMA
HAS
BECOME
ONE
WITH
THE
NIRVANA,
NEVER
SINCE
THEN
HAVE
I
MET
A
PERSON
OF
WHOM
I
FELT:
THIS
IS
A
HOLY
MAN!
ONLY
HIM,
THIS
SIDDHARTHA,
I
HAVE
FOUND
TO
BE
LIKE
THIS.
MAY
HIS
TEACHINGS
BE
STRANGE,
MAY
HIS
WORDS
SOUND
FOOLISH;
OUT
OF
HIS
GAZE
AND
HIS
HAND,
HIS
SKIN
AND
HIS
HAIR,
OUT
OF
EVERY
PART
OF
HIM
SHINES
A
PURITY,
SHINES
A
CALMNESS,
SHINES
A
CHEERFULNESS
AND
MILDNESS
AND
HOLINESS,
WHICH
I
HAVE
SEEN
IN
NO
OTHER
PERSON
SINCE
THE
FINAL
DEATH
OF
OUR
EXALTED
TEACHER.)
AS
GOVINDA
THOUGHT
LIKE
THIS,
AND
THERE
WAS
A
CONFLICT
IN
HIS
HEART,
HE
ONCE
AGAIN
BOWED
TO
SIDDHARTHA,
DRAWN
BY
LOVE.
DEEPLY
HE
BOWED
TO
HIM
WHO
WAS
CALMLY
SITTING.
"SIDDHARTHA,"
HE
SPOKE,
"WE
HAVE
BECOME
OLD
MEN.
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
FOR
ONE
OF
US
TO
SEE
THE
OTHER
AGAIN
IN
THIS
INCARNATION.
I
SEE,
BELOVED,
THAT
YOU
HAVE
FOUND
PEACE.
I
CONFESS
THAT
I
HAVEN'T
FOUND
IT.
TELL
ME,
OH
HONOURABLE
ONE,
ONE
MORE
WORD,
GIVE
ME
SOMETHING
ON
MY
WAY
WHICH
I
CAN
GRASP,
WHICH
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND!
GIVE
ME
SOMETHING
TO
BE
WITH
ME
ON
MY
PATH.
IT
IS
OFTEN
HARD,
MY
PATH,
OFTEN
DARK,
SIDDHARTHA."
SIDDHARTHA
SAID
NOTHING
AND
LOOKED
AT
HIM
WITH
THE
EVER
UNCHANGED,
QUIET
SMILE.
GOVINDA
STARED
AT
HIS
FACE,
WITH
FEAR,
WITH
YEARNING,
SUFFERING,
AND
THE
ETERNAL
SEARCH
WAS
VISIBLE
IN
HIS
LOOK,
ETERNAL
NOT-FINDING.
SIDDHARTHA
SAW
IT
AND
SMILED.
"BEND
DOWN
TO
ME!"
HE
WHISPERED
QUIETLY
IN
GOVINDA'S
EAR.
"BEND
DOWN
TO
ME!
LIKE
THIS,
EVEN
CLOSER!
VERY
CLOSE!
KISS
MY
FOREHEAD,
GOVINDA!"
BUT
WHILE
GOVINDA
WITH
ASTONISHMENT,
AND
YET
DRAWN
BY
GREAT
LOVE
AND
EXPECTATION,
OBEYED
HIS
WORDS,
BENT
DOWN
CLOSELY
TO
HIM
AND
TOUCHED
HIS
FOREHEAD
WITH
HIS
LIPS,
SOMETHING
MIRACULOUS
HAPPENED
TO
HIM.
WHILE
HIS
THOUGHTS
WERE
STILL
DWELLING
ON
SIDDHARTHA'S
WONDROUS
WORDS,
WHILE
HE
WAS
STILL
STRUGGLING
IN
VAIN
AND
WITH
RELUCTANCE
TO
THINK
AWAY
TIME,
TO
IMAGINE
NIRVANA
AND
SANSARA
AS
ONE,
WHILE
EVEN
A
CERTAIN
CONTEMPT
FOR
THE
WORDS
OF
HIS
FRIEND
WAS
FIGHTING
IN
HIM
AGAINST
AN
IMMENSE
LOVE
AND
VENERATION,
THIS
HAPPENED
TO
HIM:
HE
NO
LONGER
SAW
THE
FACE
OF
HIS
FRIEND
SIDDHARTHA,
INSTEAD
HE
SAW
OTHER
FACES,
MANY,
A
LONG
SEQUENCE,
A
FLOWING
RIVER
OF
FACES,
OF
HUNDREDS,
OF
THOUSANDS,
WHICH
ALL
CAME
AND
DISAPPEARED,
AND
YET
ALL
SEEMED
TO
BE
THERE
SIMULTANEOUSLY,
WHICH
ALL
CONSTANTLY
CHANGED
AND
RENEWED
THEMSELVES,
AND
WHICH
WERE
STILL
ALL
SIDDHARTHA.
HE
SAW
THE
FACE
OF
A
FISH,
A
CARP,
WITH
AN
INFINITELY
PAINFULLY
OPENED
MOUTH,
THE
FACE
OF
A
DYING
FISH,
WITH
FADING
EYES--HE
SAW
THE
FACE
OF
A
NEW-BORN
CHILD,
RED
AND
FULL
OF
WRINKLES,
DISTORTED
FROM
CRYING--HE
SAW
THE
FACE
OF
A
MURDERER,
HE
SAW
HIM
PLUNGING
A
KNIFE
INTO
THE
BODY
OF
ANOTHER
PERSON--HE
SAW,
IN
THE
SAME
SECOND,
THIS
CRIMINAL
IN
BONDAGE,
KNEELING
AND
HIS
HEAD
BEING
CHOPPED
OFF
BY
THE
EXECUTIONER
WITH
ONE
BLOW
OF
HIS
SWORD--HE
SAW
THE
BODIES
OF
MEN
AND
WOMEN,
NAKED
IN
POSITIONS
AND
CRAMPS
OF
FRENZIED
LOVE--HE
SAW
CORPSES
STRETCHED
OUT,
MOTIONLESS,
COLD,
VOID--
HE
SAW
THE
HEADS
OF
ANIMALS,
OF
BOARS,
OF
CROCODILES,
OF
ELEPHANTS,
OF
BULLS,
OF
BIRDS--HE
SAW
GODS,
SAW
KRISHNA,
SAW
AGNI--HE
SAW
ALL
OF
THESE
FIGURES
AND
FACES
IN
A
THOUSAND
RELATIONSHIPS
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER,
EACH
ONE
HELPING
THE
OTHER,
LOVING
IT,
HATING
IT,
DESTROYING
IT,
GIVING
RE-BIRTH
TO
IT,
EACH
ONE
WAS
A
WILL
TO
DIE,
A
PASSIONATELY
PAINFUL
CONFESSION
OF
TRANSITORINESS,
AND
YET
NONE
OF
THEM
DIED,
EACH
ONE
ONLY
TRANSFORMED,
WAS
ALWAYS
RE-BORN,
RECEIVED
EVERMORE
A
NEW
FACE,
WITHOUT
ANY
TIME
HAVING
PASSED
BETWEEN
THE
ONE
AND
THE
OTHER
FACE--AND
ALL
OF
THESE
FIGURES
AND
FACES
RESTED,
FLOWED,
GENERATED
THEMSELVES,
FLOATED
ALONG
AND
MERGED
WITH
EACH
OTHER,
AND
THEY
WERE
ALL
CONSTANTLY
COVERED
BY
SOMETHING
THIN,
WITHOUT
INDIVIDUALITY
OF
ITS
OWN,
BUT
YET
EXISTING,
LIKE
A
THIN
GLASS
OR
ICE,
LIKE
A
TRANSPARENT
SKIN,
A
SHELL
OR
MOLD
OR
MASK
OF
WATER,
AND
THIS
MASK
WAS
SMILING,
AND
THIS
MASK
WAS
SIDDHARTHA'S
SMILING
FACE,
WHICH
HE,
GOVINDA,
IN
THIS
VERY
SAME
MOMENT
TOUCHED
WITH
HIS
LIPS.
AND,
GOVINDA
SAW
IT
LIKE
THIS,
THIS
SMILE
OF
THE
MASK,
THIS
SMILE
OF
ONENESS
ABOVE
THE
FLOWING
FORMS,
THIS
SMILE
OF
SIMULTANEOUSNESS
ABOVE
THE
THOUSAND
BIRTHS
AND
DEATHS,
THIS
SMILE
OF
SIDDHARTHA
WAS
PRECISELY
THE
SAME,
WAS
PRECISELY
OF
THE
SAME
KIND
AS
THE
QUIET,
DELICATE,
IMPENETRABLE,
PERHAPS
BENEVOLENT,
PERHAPS
MOCKING,
WISE,
THOUSAND-FOLD
SMILE
OF
GOTAMA,
THE
BUDDHA,
AS
HE
HAD
SEEN
IT
HIMSELF
WITH
GREAT
RESPECT
A
HUNDRED
TIMES.
LIKE
THIS,
GOVINDA
KNEW,
THE
PERFECTED
ONES
ARE
SMILING.
NOT
KNOWING
ANY
MORE
WHETHER
TIME
EXISTED,
WHETHER
THE
VISION
HAD
LASTED
A
SECOND
OR
A
HUNDRED
YEARS,
NOT
KNOWING
ANY
MORE
WHETHER
THERE
EXISTED
A
SIDDHARTHA,
A
GOTAMA,
A
ME
AND
A
YOU,
FEELING
IN
HIS
INNERMOST
SELF
AS
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
WOUNDED
BY
A
DIVINE
ARROW,
THE
INJURY
OF
WHICH
TASTED
SWEET,
BEING
ENCHANTED
AND
DISSOLVED
IN
HIS
INNERMOST
SELF,
GOVINDA
STILL
STOOD
FOR
A
LITTLE
WHILE
BENT
OVER
SIDDHARTHA'S
QUIET
FACE,
WHICH
HE
HAD
JUST
KISSED,
WHICH
HAD
JUST
BEEN
THE
SCENE
OF
ALL
MANIFESTATIONS,
ALL
TRANSFORMATIONS,
ALL
EXISTENCE.
THE
FACE
WAS
UNCHANGED,
AFTER
UNDER
ITS
SURFACE
THE
DEPTH
OF
THE
THOUSANDFOLDNESS
HAD
CLOSED
UP
AGAIN,
HE
SMILED
SILENTLY,
SMILED
QUIETLY
AND
SOFTLY,
PERHAPS
VERY
BENEVOLENTLY,
PERHAPS
VERY
MOCKINGLY,
PRECISELY
AS
HE
USED
TO
SMILE,
THE
EXALTED
ONE.
DEEPLY,
GOVINDA
BOWED;
TEARS
HE
KNEW
NOTHING
OF,
RAN
DOWN
HIS
OLD
FACE;
LIKE
A
FIRE
BURNT
THE
FEELING
OF
THE
MOST
INTIMATE
LOVE,
THE
HUMBLEST
VENERATION
IN
HIS
HEART.
DEEPLY,
HE
BOWED,
TOUCHING
THE
GROUND,
BEFORE
HIM
WHO
WAS
SITTING
MOTIONLESSLY,
WHOSE
SMILE
REMINDED
HIM
OF
EVERYTHING
HE
HAD
EVER
LOVED
IN
HIS
LIFE,
WHAT
HAD
EVER
BEEN
VALUABLE
AND
HOLY
TO
HIM
IN
HIS
LIFE.
